SFIO: A Safe/Fast I/O Library 

Sfio is a portable library for managing I/O streams. It provides
similar functions to that of Stdio, the ANSI C Standard I/O library,
but via a distinct API that is more powerful, robust and efficient.

The current distribution is Sfio2000.

This version of the library is portable to most known UNIX platforms
including various flavors of IRIX, SUNOS, Solaris, Ultrix, MVS/OpenEdition,
Linux and BSDI. The library handles 64-bit streams on platforms that
support 64-bit files. The family of formatting functions sfprintf/sfscanf
have been extended to enable applications to define new formatting
directives as well as redefine existing ones.

The manual page has more details on recent changes.

# Software Installation Notes
#

The package should be unpacked in an installation directory, say ``Software'',
to create the following directory tree:

Software / NOTICE
           README
           include / [headers (ast_common.h, sfio.h, sfio_t.h, vthread.h)]
           lib     / [libraries (sfio.a,stdio.a,sfio-mt.a,stdio-mt.a,vthread.a)]
           bin     / [commands (iffe)]
           man     / man1 / [command manual pages (iffe.1)]
                   / man3 / [library manual pages (sfio.3, vthread.3)]
           src     / lib  / vthread / [vthread source code]
                                      features  / [feature probes]
                                      Vthread_t / [regression tests for Vthread]
                          / sfio    / [sfio source code]
                                      features  / [feature probes]
                                      Sfio_f    / [function versions of macros]
                                      Stdio_s   / [Stdio source compatibility package]
                                      Stdio_b   / [Stdio binary compatibility package]
                                      Stdio_t   / [regression tests for Stdio]
                                      Sfio_t    / [regression tests for Sfio]
                                      Sfio_dc   / [example Sfio disciplines]


Thus, the directory "Software/src/lib/sfio" contains the source code,
feature tests, function versions of macros, the Stdio source and binary
compatibility packages, example Sfio disciplines, and regression tests.

The README file tells how to build Sfio.
