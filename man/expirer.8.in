.SH DESCRIPTION
.I expirer
is a ZMailer transport agent which is used to expire selected recipients
from the queue before their normal expiration time with (possibly)
a customized message.
The
.I expirer
program must be run with root privileges and invoked with the same
current directory as the
.IR scheduler ,
namely \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-c\ \fIchannel\fR
Message recipient selector "channel" (optional)
.IP \-h\ \fI"hostname"\fR
Message recipient selector "host" (optional)
.IP \-m\ \fI"message\ string"\fR
An alternate report string.
.IP \-s
Silent mode. Message expiration occurs without any report to anywhere.
.IP \-V
prints a version message and exits.
.IP \-l\ \fIlogfile\fR
specifies a logfile.

.SH INTERFACE
This program reads in processable file names relative to the current
working directory of the scheduler (namely: \fI$POSTIOFFICE/transport/\fR).
Optionally on the same line the scheduler may tell which host is to be
looked for from the recipients of the message.
.PP
.RS
\fIrelative-spool-path\fR [ <TAB> \fIhostname\fR ]
.RE
.PP
This program produces diagnostic output on the standard output.
Normal diagnostic output is of the form:
.PP
.RS
\fIid\fR/\fIoffset\fR<TAB>\fInotify-data\fR<TAB>\fIstatus\fR \fImessage\fR
.RE
.PP
where 
.I id
is the inode number of the message file,
.I offset
is a byte offset within its control file where the address being reported
on is kept,
.I status
is one of
.BR ok ,
.BR error ,
or
.BR deferred ,
and the
.I message
is descriptive text associated with the report.  The text is terminated by
a linefeed.  Any other format (as might be produced by subprocesses)
is passed to standard output for logging in the
.B scheduler
log.
.PP
The exit status is a code from
.BR <sysexits.h> .
