.SH DESCRIPTION
.I expirer
is a ZMailer transport agent which is used to expire selected recipients
from the queue before their normal expiration time with (possibly)
a customized message.
The
.IR expirer (8zm)
program must be run with root privileges and invoked with the same
current directory as the
.IR scheduler ,
namely \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-c\ \fIchannel\fR
Message recipient selector "channel" (optional)
.IP \-h\ \fI"hostname"\fR
Message recipient selector "host" (optional)
.IP \-m\ \fI"message\ string"\fR
An alternate report string.
.IP \-s
Silent mode. Message expiration occurs without any report to anywhere.
.IP \-V
prints a version message and exits.
.IP \-l\ \fIlogfile\fR
specifies a logfile.

.SH INTERFACE
This program reads in processable file names relative to the current
working directory of the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
(namely: \fI$POSTIOFFICE/transport/\fR).
Optionally on the same line the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
may tell which host is to be looked for from the recipients of the message.

.RE
.PP
This program produces diagnostic output on the standard output.
Normal diagnostic output is of the form:
.PP
.RS
\fIid\fR/\fIoffset\fR<TAB>\fInotify-data\fR<TAB>\fIstatus\fR \fImessage\fR
.RE
.PP
where 
.I id
is the inode number of the message file,
.I offset
is a byte offset within its control file where the address being reported
on is kept,
.I status
is one of
.BR ok ,
.BR error ,
or
.BR deferred ,
and the
.I message
is descriptive text associated with the report.  The text is terminated by
a linefeed.  Any other format (as might be produced by subprocesses)
is passed to standard output for logging in the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
log.
.PP
The exit status is a code from
.BR <sysexits.h> .

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP ZCONFIG
.RS
This environment variable is expected to be inherited from the
.IR scheduler (8zm),
and it tells where scheduler's idea of
.IR ZENV -variables
are located at.
.RE
.SH Z\-ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
This program uses no \fBZMailer\fR environment variables.
