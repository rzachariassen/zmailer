.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIscheduler\fR daemon manages the delivery processing of messages
in the ZMailer.
.PP
The \fIrouter\fR(8) creates message control files in
the \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR directory.
These refer to the original message files in
the \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/queue\fR directory.
.PP
The \fIscheduler\fR reads each message control file
from \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport/\fR, translates the contained message
and destination information into internal data structures, and unlinks
the message control file.
.PP
Based on scheduling, priority, and execution information read from a
configuration file, the\ \fIscheduler\fR arranges to execute
\fITransport Agents\fR relevant to the queued messages.
.PP
At the time scheduled for a particular transport
agent invocation, the \fIscheduler\fR
will start a transport agent (or use one from idle-pool), and tell
it one by one which message control files to process.
When all the destination addresses in a message have been processed,
the \fIscheduler\fR performs error reporting tasks if any, and then
deletes the message control file in \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR and
the original message file in \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/queue\fR.
.PP
All message delivery is actually performed by Transport Agents, which
are declared in a configuration file for the \fIscheduler\fR.
Each transport agent is executed with the same current directory as
the \fIscheduler\fR.
The \fIscheduler\-transporter\fR interaction protocol is described latter
in this man-page.
.PP
The standard output of each transport agent are destination address
delivery reports; either successful delivery, unsuccessful delivery, or
deferral of the address.  Each report uses byte offsets in the message
control file to refer to the address.  Reports may also
include a comment line which will be displayed in the \fIscheduler\fR's
own reports.
.PP
Two types of reports are produced:

.IP "1." 0.4i
Error messages caused by unsuccessful delivery of a message
are appended to its message control file.  Occasionally,
for example, when all addresses have been processed, the
.I scheduler
generates an error message to the error return address of the message
(usually the original sender).  

.IP "2." 0.4i
The
.I scheduler
binds itself to a well-known TCP/IP port (\fBMAILQ\fR, TCP port 174)
on startup.  Any connections to this port are processed synchronously
in the scheduler at points in the execution where the state is
internally consistent.  The
.I scheduler
simply dumps its internal state in a terse format to the TCP stream.
It is expected that the client program will reconstruct the data structures
sufficiently to give a user a good idea of what the scheduler thinks the
world looks like.  The
.IR mailq (1)
program serves this purpose.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
Invoking
.I scheduler
without any argument will start it as a daemon.

.IP \-d 1i
run as a daemon, usually used after \-v to log daemon activity in great
detail.

.IP "\-E \fInewentsmax\fR"
when globbing new tasks from the directory, pick only first ``newentsmax''
of them, and leave rest for a new scan run.

.IP "\-f \fIconfigfile\fR"
overrides the default configuration file \fIMAILSHARE\fB/scheduler.cf\fR.

.IP "\-F"
Freeze -- don't actually run anything, just do queue scanning.
(For debug purposes..)

.IP "\-H \-HH"
.RS
Use multi-level hashing at the spool directories.
This will efficiently reduce the lengths of the scans at the directories
to find some arbitary file in them.
One `H' means "single level hashing", two `HH's mean "dual level hashing".
``Hash'' is directory which name is single upper case alphabet (A-Z).
.LP
When existing, ZENV variable
.I SCHEDULERDIRHASH
overrides the `H' option.
.RE

.IP "\-i"
run interactively, i.e., not as a daemon.

.IP "\-L \fIlogfile\fR"
overrides the default log file location \fILOGDIR\fB/scheduler\fR.

.IP "\-l \fIstatisticslog\fR"
starts the appending of delivery statistics information (ASCII form)
into given file.  No default value.

.IP "\-M [1|2]"
Version of the
.I mailq
protocol this server runs; essentially a test option, as
existence of
.I PARAMauthfile=".."
assignment at the
.I scheduler.conf
file turns the protocol into version 2.

.IP "\-N \fItransmaxfno\fR"
sets how many filehandles are allocated for the scheduler's started
children (if the system has adjustable resources.)

.IP "\-n"
.RS
Toggles configuration flag `default_full_content', which defines what
will be DSN RET parameter assumed value in case the originator didn't
supply that parameter.
.LP
Default behaviour is similar to RET=FULL, while usage of this option
is equivalent of RET=HDRS.  This option does not override originator
supplied DSN RET parameter value.

.IP "\-p \fIchannel/host\fR"
A debug-type option for running selectively some thread under a single
instance of the
.IR scheduler .
.LP
Use this with options: \-v
.RE

.IP "\-P \fIpostoffice\fR"
specifies an alternate \fIPOSTOFFICE\fR directory.

.IP "\-q \fIrendezvous\fR"
on machines without TCP/IP networking, the rendezvous between
.I scheduler
and
.IR mailq (1)
is done using a well-known named pipe.  This option overrides the default
location for this special file, either \fIRENDEZVOUS\fR or
\fB/usr/tmp/.mailq.text\fR.

.IP "\-Q"
The ``Q''-mode, don't output the old style data into the queue querier,
only the new-style one.

.IP "\-S"
Synchronous startup mode, scans all jobs at the directory before starting
even the first transporter.

.IP "\-v"
be verbose about activity, and do not detach as a daemon.

.IP "\-W"
be used in conjunction with \-v to delay verbose logging
start until after all the files have been parsed in, and
it is a time for doing scheduling.

.IP "\-V"
print version message and run interactively.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The
.I scheduler
configuration file consists of a set of clauses.  Each clause is selected by
the pattern it starts with.  The patterns for the clauses are matched,
in sequence, with the
.IR channel / host
string for each recipient address.
When a clause pattern matches an address, the parameters set in the clause
will be applied to the
.IR scheduler 's
processing of that address.  If the clause specifies a command,
the clause pattern matching sequence is terminated.
This is a clause:
.PP
.RS
.nf
local/*
.RS
interval=10s
expiry=3h
# want 20 channel slots in case of blockage on one
maxchannel=20
# want 20 thread-ring slots
maxring=20
command="mailbox -8"
.RE
.fi
.RE
.PP
A clause consists of:
.PP
.RS 0.3i
.TP 0.3i
\(bu
A selection pattern (in shell style) that is matched against the
\fIchannel\fR/\fIhost\fR string for an address.
.TP 0.3i
\(bu
0 or more variable assignments or keywords (described below).
.PP
.RE
.PP
There are several possible
.BR PARAM -assignments
starting at column 0, more of them below.
.PP
If the selection pattern does not contain a '/', it is assumed to
be a channel pattern and the host pattern is assumed to be the wildcard '*'.
.PP
The components of a clause are separated by whitespace.  The pattern
introducing a clause must start in the first column of a line, and the
variable assignments or keywords inside a clause must not start in the
first column of a line.  This means a clause may be written both compactly
all on one line, or spread out with an assignment or keyword per line.
.PP
If the clause is empty (i.e., consists only of a pattern), then the
contents of the next non-empty clause will be used.
.PP
The typical configuration file will contain the following clauses:
.PP
.RS 0.3i
.TP 0.3i
\(bu
a clause matching all addresses (using the pattern
.BR */* )
that sets up default values.
.TP 0.3i
\(bu
a clause matching the local delivery channel (usually
.BR local ).
.TP 0.3i
\(bu
a clause matching the deferred delivery channel (usually
.BR hold ).
.TP 0.3i
\(bu
a clause matching the error reporting channel (usually
.BR error ).
.TP 0.3i
\(bu
clauses specific to the other channels known by the
.IR router ,
for example,
.B smtp
and
.BR uucp .
.RE
.RE
.PP
The actual names of these channels are completely controlled by the
.I router
configuration file.
.PP
Empty lines, and lines whose first non-whitespace character is '#',
are ignored.
.PP
Variable values may be unquoted words or values or doublequoted strings.
Intervals (delta time) are specified using a concatenation of: numbers
suffixed with 's', 'm', 'h', or 'd' modifiers designating the number as
a second, minute, hour, or day value.  For example: 1h5m20s.
.PP
The known variables and keywords, and their typical values and semantics are:

.IP "interval (1m)"
specifies the primary retry interval, which determines how frequently
a transport agent should be scheduled for an address.  The value is a
delta time specification.
This value, and the
.I retries
value mentioned below, are combined to determine the interval between
each retry attempt.

.IP "idlemax (3x interval)"
When a transport agent runs out of jobs, they are moved to ``idle pool'',
and it a TA spends more than
.I idlemax
time in there, it is terminated.

.IP "expiry (3d)"
specifies the maximum age of an address in the
.I scheduler
queue before a repeatedly deferred address is bounced with an expiration
error.  The actual report is produced when all addresses have
been processed.

.IP "retries (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34)"
specifies the retry interval policy of the
.I scheduler
for an address.  The value must be a sequence of positive integers, these
being multiples of the primary interval before a retry is scheduled.  The
.I scheduler
starts by going through the sequence as an address is repeatedly deferred.
When the end of the sequence is reached, the
.I scheduler
will jump into the sequence at a random spot and continue towards the
end.  This allows various retry strategies to be specified easily:
.PP

etc.
.fi
.RE
.PP

.IP "maxta (0)"
.RS
This is
.B global
parameter limiting the number of transport-agent processes that
the sceduler can have running concurrently.
.LP
If retrying an address would cause the number of simultaneously active
transport agents to exceed the specified value, the retry is postponed.
.LP
When no
.I maxta
parameter is used, or '0' is used, the
.I scheduler
(at operating systems supporting it) uses getrlimit(2)/setrlimit(2) to
maximize the number of available file descriptors for the process.
The thus maximized value minus about 20 is then used as 
.I maxta
value.
.LP
At some operating systems there are no bidirectional pipes or sockets
for the scheduler to talk with the transport agents, thus at those systems
each TA process uses
.B two
.IR pipe (2)
file-handles, and thus system-wide limit on
.I maxta
halves from what was maximum derived above.
.RE

.IP "maxchannel (0)"
.RS
This limits the number of concurrent transport agent processes for which
the
.I channel
part of the address quad are same.
.LP
The default value is copied from the
.IR maxta .
.LP
It is advisable, although not mandatory, to have the same value for all
.I maxchannel
parameters at all clauses with matching channel parts.
.LP
Case where non-alike values might make sense is when you want to guarantee
resources for a subset of destinations, e.g. for all other "smtp/" clauses
have 
.I maxchannel
of say 100, but for your very important domain domain have there a bit
higher, say: 120.
.RE

.IP "maxring (0)"
.RS
The recipients are groupped into ``threads'' by recipient channel+host parts,
and threads matching same selector clause are groupped into ``thread-rings'',
where same transport agent can be switched over from one recipient to another.
.LP
This parameter defines how many transport agents can be running at any time
at the ring.
.LP
When no limit is given, then
.I maxta
value is used for default.
.RE

.IP "maxthr (1)"
.RS
This limits the number of parallel transport agents within each
thread; that is, using higher value than default ``1'' will allow
running more than one TA for the jobs at the thread.
.LP
Do note that running more than one TA in parallel may also require
lowering OVERFEED value.  (E.g. having a queue of 30 messages will
not benefit from more TAs, unless they all get something to process.
Having OVERFEED per default at 150 will essentially feed whole queue
to one TA, others are not getting any.)
.RE

.IP "overfeed (150)"
.RS
Because the scheduler spins around a bit sluggishly to spot
active TAs, it does make sense to feed more than one task to a TA,
and then wait for the results, thus came about the ``overfeed''
mechanism.
.LP
This tells how many job specifiers to feed to the TA when
the TA process state is ``STUFFING.''
.RE

.IP "skew (5)"
Leftover from earlier scheduler internal structure.
Does not make sense anymore.

.IP "user (root)"
is the user id of a transport agent processing the address.  The value
is either numeric (a uid) or an account name.

.IP "group (daemon)"
is the group id of a transport agent processing the address.  The value
is either numeric (a gid) or a group name.

.IP "command (smtp -srl ${LOGDIR}/smtp $host)"
.RS
is the command line used to start a transport agent to process the address.
.LP
The program pathname is specified relative to the \fIMAILBIN\fB/ta\fR
directory.
.LP
The string "$channel" is replaced by the current matched channel,
and "$host" is replaced by the current matched host, from the destination
address, and "${LOGDIR}" substitutes ZENV variable LOGDIR value there.
.LP
\fIIt is strongly recommended that the "$host" is not to be used on
a command definition, as it limits the usability of idled transporter.\fR
.LP
It is possible to place environment-string setting statements into
the beginning of the line:
.LP
.RS 0.3i
.nf
command="MALLOC_DEBUG_=1 OTHER=var  cmdname cmdparams"
.fi
.RE
.RE

.IP queueonly
.RS
a clause with
.I queueonly
flag does not auto-start at the arrival of a message, instead it
.B must
be started by means of
.IR smtpserver (8)
command
.B ETRN
thru an SMTP connection.
.LP
To have message expiration working, following additional entries are
suggested:
.I interval=1h retries="24"
.RE

.PP
For example, this is a complete configuration file:
.PP
.nf
.RS
# Default values

command="smtp -esrl $LOGDIR/smtp"
.RE
uucp/*
.RS
maxchannel=5 command="sm -c $channel uucp"
.RE
.RE
.fi

.PP
The first clause (*/*) sets up default values for all addresses.  There
is no command specification, so clause matching will continue after
address have picked up the parameters set here.

.PP
The third clause (error) has an implicit host wildcard of '*', so it would
match the same as specifying error/* would have.

.PP
The fifth clause (smtp/*.toronto.edu) has no further components so it
selects the components of the following non-empty clause (the sixth).

.PP
Both the fifth and sixth clauses are specific to address destinations
within the TORONTO.EDU and UTORONTO.CA organization (the two are parallel
domains).  At most 10 deliveries to the \fBsmtp\fR channel may be concurrently
active, and at most 2 for all possible hosts within TORONTO.EDU.
If $host is mentioned in the command specification, the transport
agent will only be told about the message control files that indicate
SMTP delivery to a particular host.  The actual host is picked at random
from the current choices, to avoid systematic errors leading to a deadlock
of any queue.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE PARAM-ASSIGNMENTS
The scheduler can assign several of its internal parameters
by having variable assignments beginning at column 0, and
beginning with "PARAM" text:

.TP 0.4i
PARAMmailqpath\ \=\ "UNIX:/path/to/pf_unix/mailq/socket"
.TP 0.4i
PARAMmailqpath\ \=\ "TCP:mailq"
.TP 0.4i
PARAMmailqpath\ \=\ "TCP:174"
These define two different types of possible socket addresses for the
.RI " mailq "
protocol; a UNIX socket, and a TCP socket.
Default is "TCP:174".

.IP PARAMautfile\ \=\ "/path/to/scheduler.auth"
Location of MAILQv2 autentication control file
.IP PARAMglobal-report-interval\ \=\ 15m
Interval by which all permanent reports accumulated into a message
are reported by; sends out early reports of delivery failures, and
does not force to wait for maximum queue timeout in case the message
has more than once recipient.

.SH MESSAGE CONTROL FILE SYNTAX
A message control file contains all the information needed by delivery
programs like \fIscheduler\fR and the transport agents.
It is a terse presentation of the
.IR router 's
decisions, along with some useful reference information.

.PP
The message control file consists of a number of fields.

All fields start in the first column (i.e., at the beginning of the file
or just after a newline), and most fields extend to the end of line.
The one exception is the message header field which extends till
a double-newline terminator.

For all but this message header field, the second column is reserved for
a tag byte.  This position is used to lock the field and to indicate
the status of past processing of the field.  For example, the success
or failure of delivery to a recipient address is indicated by a '+' or
'-' in the second column of that field.  A space ' ' in that position
means the field has not been processed, or that processing has been deferred.
A '~' indicates the field is locked because some transport agent is
currently processing delivery for the address.
The known field names and tags are defined in \fB<mail.h>\fR.

For all the
.I recipient
addresses, there is 6 characters space for transport-agent process-id
so that a quickly restarted scheduler will not do double-delivery on some
slowly running transporter.

.PP
The following fields are mandatory:

.IP "@ 0xHHHHHH"
.RS
Carries hex-encoded bitflags of what kind of format this dataset really is in.
.LP
This is to ensure that ``featurefullness'' relation of:
router <= scheduler <= TA-programs is not violated, and that the messages in
the spool meet this criteria too.
.LP
Rolling binaries back too far might break things.
.RE

.IP "i 123456\-789"
the name of the message file in the
.I POSTOFFICE\fB/queue
directory and of the message control file in the
.I POSTOFFICE\fB/transport
directory.
'i' is a mnemonic for 'inode' since message file names must be unique on
the system and therefore are named by their inode number.

.IP "o NNNNNNN"
the byte offset of the message body in the original message.

.PP
The following fields will frequently exist:

.IP "e user@some.domain"
is the return address for error messages, in a form that can be put in
a To: header line.

.IP "l <mumble@jumble>"
is a string identifying this message in log entries.  Typically the message
id of the message would be used.

.PP
The following fields will occasionally appear:

.IP "x <jumble@mumble>"
is the log identification string (usually a message id) of an obsoleted
message.  The scheduler will purge any such identified message after
running sanity checks.

.IP "v ../public/v_filename"
is the name of a file that the delivery system can appended log information
to.  This would appear as the result of running
.B sendmail -v
or
.BR Mail\ -v .

Since all programs need to refer to the same file, on mail clusters
it is recommended that this be a relative path naming a file within
the
.I POSTOFFICE
directory hierarchy.

.PP
A message control file must contain at least one address "group".
Each group consists of a sender address field, one or more recipient
address fields, and a message header that goes along with these.

An address field is a string containing a space-separated 4-tuple (quad)
as follows:

.IP "channel"
is the name of the delivery channel for this address.  This must be
a contiguous word.

.IP "host"
is the name of the next destination host for this address.  This too
must be a contiguous word.

.IP "user"
is the address to be handed to the destination host for further delivery.
This string may contain space.  It is distinguishable because the last
component cannot contain spaces.

.IP "privilege"
is the numeric uid representing the privileges associated with this address.

.PP
The address group components are:

.IP "s <address quad>"
carries a sender address field in address-quad form.

.IP "r PPPPPPDDDD<address quad>"
is a recipient address field in address quad form, but also
contains fields for transprort agent pid number (PPPPPP), and
a four character space for delay reporting by the scheduler (DDDD).

.IP "N string"
are the delivery-status-notification parameters for the previous recipient.

.IP "n string"
is the delivery-status-notification environment id data for the previous
recipient.

.IP "R string"
The DSN RET-mode setting (HDRS/FULL) for the previous recipient.

.IP "X nnnnnn"
is an XOR recipient address field.  The first element is a tag (a class number)
to identify collections of recipient addresses which are equivalent
(and therefore mutually exclusive).  This is followed by an address field
as described above.

.IP "m"
carries the message header for this address group.

.PP
After one or more of these address groups, the error messages for addresses
are appended to the message control file.  This is done by the
.I scheduler
as it receives error reports from transport agents.

.IP "d <diag-string>"
.RS
Is storage format for diagnostics for recipient addresses.
.PP
Structure of the diagnostic string is:
.nf
  d \fIid\fR:\fIheaderoffset\fR:\fIdrptoffset\fR::\fIdiagtime\fR \\t \fInotarydata\fR \\t \fImessage\fR
  d 172:347:226::964917927 ...
.fi
.PP
The \fIid\fR field tells the byte offset to tge ``r'' of the receiver
definition line.
.PP
The \fIheaderoffset\fR gives the byte offset of the first byte of the
\fIheaders\fR associated with the address group.
.PP
The \fIdrptoffset\fR points to the possible ``N'' line.
.PP
The \fIdiagtime\fR is just system time of the event.
.PP
The \fInotarydata\fR and \fImessage\fR are explained further below, and
are identical to the transport-agent to the scheduler communication
protocol objects of the same name.
.RE
.PP
For example, this is a typical message control file (it is a snapshot taken
while a transport agent was running):

.SH TRANSPORT AGENT INTERFACE
The transport agent interface follows master-slave -model, where the TA
informs the
.I scheduler
that it is ready for the work, and then the scheduler sends it
one job description, and awaits for diagnostics.
Once the job is finished, the TA notifies the scheduler that it
is ready for a new job.

is passed to standard output for logging in the

The

either an incremental time in seconds if prefixed by
.BR + ,
or otherwise an absolute time in seconds since epoch.

The first line (all bytes up to an ASCII LF character, octal 12) is used
to identify the syntax of all bytes following the line terminator \fBLF\fR.
The first 8 characters of the first line are "\fBversion \fR" as a check that
this is indeed a \fBMAILQ\fR port server that has been reached, the remaining
bytes are the real data format identification.  The data is interpreted
according to that format until the terminating connection close.

Format identifiers should be registered with the author.
Currently identified ones are:

This is sufficient information to be able to reconstruct the transport queues
as seen by the scheduler process, and to find more information than what is
shown here by actually looking up the message control and data files referred
to.
.SH MAILQv2 PROTOCOL
The MAILQv2 protocol is interactive autenticating protocol, unlike
its predecessor (v1).  The system begins with a greeting telling
version, and then giving one line of challenge to be used in subsequent
autentication command:

Protocol commands are:
.IP "AUTH username hexauthenticator"
The "login" of the mailq session.  The hexauthenticator is
lowercase hexadecimal character printout of MD5 checksum ran
over the catenate of the challenge string (without its ending
newline character), and the user's password.
This algorithm is essentially the same what APOP scheme uses.
.PP
PERLish example with above challenge:

  \fC$authen = MD5hex("MAILQ-V2-CHALLENGE: 942665308.906504.3"."my-passwd")
