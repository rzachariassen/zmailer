file for ZMailer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aliases
.SH DESCRIPTION (aliases)
All lines beging with `#' are comments.
.PP
Lines begining with white space are extensions to previous
line.
.PP
This file describes user ID aliases used by
.IR zmailer (1zm).
The file resides in ZMailer's database directory, which
usually has a symlink to this file from
.I /etc.
Content of the file is formatted as a series of lines of form:
.PP
.RS
\fC name: name2, name3, name4, ...
.RE
.PP
Each "name:" label must be valid RFC-822 localpart or address entity,
and the colon must not have white-space in between 'name', and itself.
.PP
The labels may actually be quoted-strings in RFC-822 style:
.PP
.RS
.nf
"with space":
.fi
.RE
.PP
Valid labels include:
.PP
.RS
.nf
postmaster:
postmaster@zmailer.org:
"post office manager":
.fi
.RE
.PP
The targets must be valid RFC-822 address type objects; specifically
following BSD-Sendmail type things do not work, and must be converted
to RFC-822 format:
.PP
.RS
\fC bsd-name:  |/path/to/foo/faa,   \\bsd-name
\fC zm-name:  "|/path/to/foo/faa", "\\zm-name"
\fC both-name: user@somewhere, another@elsewere
.RE
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION (.forward)
The
.B .forward
file contains addresses that users want their incoming email
to be sent to.
It may be some program (like procmail), or it may be another address.
Some examples for user "user":
.PP
.RS
\fC "user", "|/path/to/vacation"
\fC "user", another@address
.RE
.PP
BSD-Sendmail lets those addresses be written without quotes,
however it is against RFC-822 rules.
