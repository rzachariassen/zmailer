.SH NAME
rmail \- zmailer program to process incoming uucp mail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBrmail\fR 6em
[\fB\-d\fR]
[\fB\-h\fR\ \fIsomewhere\fR]
\fIrecipient...\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I rmail (1zm)
is usually invoked by a remote UUCP neighbour host's mailer using
a command line like:
.PP
.RS 3em
.nf
uux - -r -a\fIsender\fR -gC \fIthishost\fR!rmail (\fIrecipient1\fR) (\fIrecipient2\fR) ...
.fi
.RE
.PP
The end result is the remote neighbour's
.IR uuxqt (8)
runs
.IR rmail (1zm)
on
.I thishost
with this command line:
.PP
.RS 3em
.nf
rmail \fIrecipient1\fR \fIrecipient2\fR ...
.fi
.RE
.PP
In both cases, a UUCP format mail message is on the standard input.
.PP
The task of
.IR rmail (1zm)
is to transform the trace information in the UUCP format message to the
equivalent RFC822 trace information, and to submit the message to the
.B ZMailer
.IR router (8zm)
with the appropriate envelope information.
.PP
The expected input format looks like:
.PP
.RS 3em
.nf
\fBFrom\fR \fIaddress3\fR  \fIdate3\fR \fBremote from\fR \fIhost3\fR
\fB>From\fR \fIaddress2\fR  \fIdate2\fR \fBremote from\fR \fIhost2\fR
\fB>From\fR \fIaddress1\fR  \fIdate1\fR \fBremote from\fR \fIhost1\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
followed by the rest of the message.
This is considered equivalent to the following
(as it might appear in a mailbox):
.PP
.RS 3em
.nf
\fBFrom\fR \fIhost3\fR!\fIhost2\fR!\fIhost1\fR!\fIaddress1\fR \fIdate\fR
\fBReceived: by \fIhost3\fR ... ; \fIdate3\fR
\fBReceived: by \fIhost2\fR ... ; \fIdate2\fR
\fBReceived: by \fIhost1\fR ... ; \fIdate1\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
In order for the mailer to process the incoming message properly,
.IR rmail (1zm)
must be run by a userid which the
.IR router (8zm)
will accept forged mail from.
This is normally the
.B uucp
account id.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-d
turns on debugging output.
.IP \-h\ \fIsomewhere\fR
will use the argument as the default remote UUCP host name to use if there is
no "\fBremote from\fR \fIhost\fR" tag in the first From-space line in the
message.  The default value for this is usually
.B somewhere
or
.B uunet
(since uunet was a frequent purveyor of this protocol violation).
