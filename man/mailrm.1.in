.SH NAME
mailrm \- zmailer mail queue message remover
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mailrm
[
.I id
\&...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mailrm
attempts to remove the locally queued mail messages named on its
command line by submitting mail messages that cancel the queued messages.
.PP
The Obsoletes: message header is the mechanism used to accomplish this.
The
.I router
turns it into a message control file directive that the
.I scheduler
implements.  The
.I scheduler
will of course do its best to ensure only the owner of a message can cancel it.
Therefore this program is only useful to whomever originally sent the message
to be cancelled.  The super user is not treated specially.
.PP
The
.I id
is the message file id of a to-be-cancelled message, as it is reported by
.IR mailq .
It is not the message id, although that is the information that is actually
sought for the Obsoletes: header contents.
.I mailrm
will rummage through message control files in \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR
to retrieve the message id for a given message file id.
