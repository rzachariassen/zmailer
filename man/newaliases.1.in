.SH NAME
newaliases \- zmailer aliases database rebuilder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B newaliases
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBThis document is way out of date in data formats.\fR
.PP
The
.IR newaliases (1)
rebuilds the aliases database used by the
.IR router (8)
configuration at most sites.
.PP
The database is a sorted list of (alias,byteoffset) values,
with the byteoffset referring to a digested file containing
the raw data from the normal aliases file.
The indirection allows the alias entries to be arbitrarily
large without running into representational limits.
.PP
\fINote: Modern systems use e.g. SleepyCat DB instead of these
arcane indirection schemes.
Classical DBM systems weren't good enough due to e.g. NDBM having
a limit of 1 kilobyte of key + data!\fR
.PP
The
.IR router (8)
must be available to interpret this script, as it provides the address
digestification functionality.  By convention, signal 16 is sent to
the
.I router
when it should flush and reopen the aliases database.
