.SH NAME
hold \- zmailer deferred processing transport agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBhold\fR 5em
[\fB\-V\fR]
[\fB\-c\fR\ \fIchannel\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I hold
is a ZMailer transport agent which is usually only run by the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
program to test conditions for reprocessing of previously deferred
message addresses.  The
.I hold
program must be run with the same
current directory as the
.IR scheduler ,
namely \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR.
.PP
The program will interpret the host part of an address destined for its channel
as a condition that must be met before the original address (in the user part)
can be reprocessed by the router.  The condition specification contains
a general condition class name followed by colon followed by a parameter string.
The currently supported condition classes are:
.IP \fBns\fR
succeeds when the nameserver lookup indicated by the parameter does
not produce a temporary nameserver error.  The parameter is a domain
name followed by a slash followed by a standard Internet nameserver
Resource Record type name.
.IP \fBtimeout\fR
succeeds when the time given by the parameter (in normal seconds-since-epoch
format) has passed.
.IP \fBage\fR
succeeds when message spool file is at least of given age.
The interval can be given in complex '1d5h7m3s' -format.
.IP \fBio\fR
succeeds 10% of the time, to allow retry of temporary I/O failures.
.IP \fBscript\fR
runs the named shell script with the optional given argument.  The parameter
is a simple name, the shell script name within the \fIMAILBIN\fB/bin\fR
directory, optionally followed by a slash followed by an argument to
be passed to the shell script.
.IP \fBhome\fR
This tries to locate home-directory for named user, and then
tries to \fIstat()\fR the directory, until it succeeds.
.PP
For example:
.PP

.nf

AGE:2h
IO:error

.PP
The condition class name is case-insensitive but is capitalized by convention.
The parameter strings are case-preserved for condition class-specific
interpretation.  Whitespace is not permitted.
.PP
The envelope of the resubmitted message is created from the sender and
(no longer deferred) recipient addresses, and a "via suspension" header.
.SH OPTIONS
Options are:
.IP \-c\ \fIchannel\fR
specifies which channel name should be keyed on.  The default is
.BR hold .
.IP \-V
prints a version message and exits.
.SH INTERFACE
This program reads in processable file names relative to the current
working directory of the scheduler (namely: \fI$POSTIOFFICE/transport/\fR).
Optionally on the same line the scheduler may tell which host is to be
looked for from the recipients of the message.

.RE
.PP
This program produces diagnostic output on the standard output.
Normal diagnostic output is of the form:
.PP
.RS
\fIid\fR/\fIoffset\fR/\fIstatus\fR \fImessage\fR
.RE
.PP
where 
.I id
is the inode number of the message file,
.I offset
is a byte offset within its control file where the address being reported
on is kept,
.I status
is one of
.BR ok ,
.BR error ,
or
.BR deferred ,
and the
.I message
is descriptive text associated with the report.  The text is terminated by
a linefeed.  Any other format (as might be produced by subprocesses)
is passed to standard output for logging in the
.B scheduler
log.
.PP
The exit status is a code from
.BR <sysexits.h> .

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP ZCONFIG
.RS
This environment variable is expected to be inherited from the
.IR scheduler (8zm),
and it tells where scheduler's idea of
.IR ZENV -variables
are located at.
.RE
.SH Z\-ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
Following \fIZENV-variables\fR are used by the \fBhold\fR program:
.PP
.IP "PATH, ZCONFIG, MAILBIN, MAILSHARE"
These four are passed onwards to script execution environment.
