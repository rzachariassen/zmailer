.SH NAME
mboxpath \- ZMailer utility to show user's mailbox path
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBmboxpath\fR 9em
[\fB\-D\fR[\fBD\fR]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.IR mboxpath (1)
is a ZMailer utility program to be used when local user directories
have been scattered around, and it is desired to have user's shell
environment variable
.B MAIL
be set to where ever his/her UNIX mailbox file is.

This does only manage scattering under common
.I \-d\ dirpath
directory prefix, but usually that is sufficient.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-d\ \fIdirpath\fR
See
.IR mailbox (8).
.IP \-D[D]
See
.IR mailbox (8).
.IP \-P[P]

.IP \-X[X]

.SH USAGE
This is intended for system-wide startup script usage with
code something like following for sh:
.PP
.RS
\fCMAIL=`mboxpath\ \ \-P\ \ $USER`\fR
.RE
.PP
It is important to use SAME options here as are used at running
the mailbox program.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The default location for user mailbox files depends per system,
but one of them is:
.BR /var/mail .
This may be modified by setting the variable
.B MAILBOX
in
.B /etc/zmailer.conf
to the directory containing user mailbox files, for example
.BR /usr/spool/mail .
This is best done in the ZMailer SiteConfig file.

This program outputs the
.I likely
mailbox location to the stdout, it does not go and see if there is anything.
.SH FILES

While this utility does read
.IR ZENV -variable
.BR ZCONFIG ,
the read
.RB ' MAILBOX '
variable can be overridden with the
.I '\-d'
option.
