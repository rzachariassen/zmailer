.SH NAME
errormail \- zmailer error message transport agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBerrormail\fR 10em
[\fB\-c\fR\ \fIchannel\fR]
[\fB\-V\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I errormail
is a ZMailer transport agent which is usually only run by the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
program to produce error messages from canned forms.  The
.I errormail
program must be invoked with the same
current directory as the
.IR scheduler (8zm),
namely \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR.
.PP
The program will interpret the host part of an address destined for its channel
as a file name in the \fIMAILSHARE\fB/forms\fR directory.  It will submit a
new mail message consisting of the concatenation of:
.RS 3em
.TP 4em
\(bu
a To: header containing the sender address (original error return address),
.TP 4em
\(bu
the file contents of the specified form,
.TP 4em
\(bu
the user name of each recipient address with some descriptive text indicating
the specific error, and
.TP 4em
\(bu
the message file being processed.
.RE
.PP
This program will not report anything (except to syslog) if the original
message is an error message ("channel error" kind, e.g. "MAIL FROM:<>").
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-c\ \fIchannel\fR
specifies which channel name should be keyed on.
The default is
.BR error .
.IP \-V
prints a version message and exits.
.SH INTERFACE
This program reads in processable file names relative to the current
working directory of the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
(namely: \fI$POSTIOFFICE/transport/\fR).
Optionally on the same line the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
may tell which host is to be looked for from the recipients of the message.

.RS
\fIrelative-spool-path\fR [ <TAB> \fIhostname\fR ]
.RE
.PP
This program produces diagnostic output on the standard output.
Normal diagnostic output is of the form:
.PP
.RS
\fIid\fR/\fIoffset\fR<TAB>\fInotify-data\fR<TAB>\fIstatus\fR \fImessage\fR
.RE
.PP
where 
.I id
is the inode number of the message file,
.I offset
is a byte offset within its control file where the address being reported
on is kept,
.I status
is one of
.BR ok ,
.BR error ,
or
.BR deferred ,
and the
.I message
is descriptive text associated with the report.  The text is terminated by
a linefeed.  Any other format (as might be produced by subprocesses)
is passed to standard output for logging in the
.IR scheduler (8zm)
log.
.PP
The exit status is a code from
.BR <sysexits.h> .
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP ZCONFIG
.RS
This environment variable is expected to be inherited from the
.IR scheduler (8zm),
and it tells where scheduler's idea of
.IR ZENV -variables
are located at.
.RE
.SH Z\-ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
Following \fIZENV-variables\fR are used by the \fBmailbox\fR program:
.PP
.IP MAILSHARE
This supplies the location of the directory under which
"$MAILSHARE/forms/hostpart" files are located.
.IP "POSTOFFICE, ROUTERDIRHASH, ROUTERNOTIFY, etc.."
Variables used by
.IR zmailer (3zm)
library, while posting error messages.
