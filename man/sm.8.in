.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sm
is a ZMailer transport agent which is usually only run by the
.IR scheduler (8),
to deliver messages by invoking a program with facilities and in a way
compatible with a Sendmail mailer.  The
.I sm
program must be run with the same
current directory as the
.IR scheduler ,
namely \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR.
.PP
The program scans the message control files named on stdin for addresses
destined for the channel and/or the host given on the command line.  If any
are found, all matching addresses and messages are processed according to
the specifications for the
.I mailer
in the configuration file.
.PP
The exit status of a
.I mailer
should be one of the standard values specified in \fB<sysexits.h>\fR.
Of these, \fBEX_OK\fR indicates successful deliver, and
\fBEX_DATAERR\fR, \fBEX_NOUSER\fR, \fBEX_NOHOST\fR, \fBEX_UNAVAILABLE\fR,
and \fBEX_NOPERM\fR indicate permanent failure.  All other exit codes
will be treated as a temporary failure and the delivery will be retried.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-8
tells that the output is 8-bit clean, and for any MIME message with
\fIQUOTED-PRINTABLE\fR encoding the coding can be decoded.
.IP \-Q
tells that the transport channel will likely treat poorly control
characters like TAB, and possibly SPACE too..  This encodes them all
by using \fIQUOTED-PRINTABLE\fR encoding.
.IP \-f\ \fIconfigfile\fR
specifies the name of a configuration file containing specifications of
the various known Sendmail compatible mailer programs: how to invoke them
and how to process messages for them.  The default is \fIMAILSHARE\fB/sm.cf\fR.
.IP \-c\ \fIchannel\fR
specifies which channel name should be keyed on.  There is no default.
If this option is not specified, the \-h option must be.
.IP \-h\ \fIhost\fR
specifies which host name should be keyed on.  There is no default.
If this option is not specified, the \-c option must be.
.IP \-V
prints a version message and exits.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file associates the
.I mailer
keyword from the command line with a specification of a delivery program.
This is very similar to the way the definition of a mailer in Sendmail
requires flags, a program name, and a command line specification.
These are in fact the fields of the entries of the configuration file.
Lines starting with whitespace or a ``#'' are ignored, and all others are
assumed to follow this format:
.sp
.ta 1i 1.7i 4.3i
.nf
\fImailer	flags	program	argument list\fR
.fi
.sp
For example:
.sp
.nf
local	mS	sm/localm	localm -r $g $u
prog	-	/bin/sh	sh -c $u
tty	rs	/usr/local/to	to $u
uucp	U	/usr/bin/uux	uux - -r -a$g -gC $h!rmail ($u)
usenet	m	sm/usenet	usenet $u
ean	mn	/local/lib/ean/gwsmean	gwsmean -d $u
test	n	sm/test	test $u
smsgw	nS	${MAILBIN}/sms-gw sms-gw $g $u
.fi
.PP
The
.I mailer
field extends from the beginning of the line to the first whitespace.  It
is used simply as a key index to the configuration file contents.  Whitespace
is used as the field separator for all the fields.
.PP
The
.I flags
field contains a concatenation of one-letter flags.  If no flags are desired,
a ``-'' character should be used to indicate presense of the field.  All normal
Sendmail flags are recognized, but the ones that do not make sense in the
context of ZMailer will produce an error.

The flags that change the behaviour of
.I sm
and their comparisons against
.I sendmail-8.11
are:

.IP \-
.I sendmail: Not defined/used

.I sm:
Special ``no flags defined'' dummy entry

.IP ":, |, /, %, @"
.I sendmail:
various sendmail-specific things that are handled mostly by the
.I router
subsystem at ZMailer.

.I sm: Not used

.IP 0
.I sendmail:
Equivalent of ZMailer's
.I smtp
transport agents
.I \-x
option.  (Don't use MX data, only addresses)

.I sm: Not used

.IP "1, 2"
.I sendmail, sm: Not defined/used

.IP 3
.I sendmail:
Extend the list of characters converted to =XX notation when converting to
Quoted-Printable to include those that don't map cleanly between ASCII
and EBCDIC.  Usefull if you have IBM mainframes on site.

.I sm: Not implemented/used

.IP 4
.I sendmail, sm: Not defined/used

.IP 5
.I sendmail:
Local delivery alternate resolution ruleset (R5) in case no aliases
are found for currently processed address.

.IP 6
.I sendmail:
Strip RFC 822 headers to 7 bits.

.I sm: Not implemented/used

.IP 7
.I sendmail:
Will strip (set to 0) the 8th bit of every character in the message.

.I sm:
Will strip the 8th bit of every character of the message body, does
not touch message headers.
.I (Not stripping message header is sort of BUG.)

.IP 8
.I sendmail, sm:
Tells that the recipient system is 8-bit capable and that no
8->7 downgrading is needed.

.IP 9
.I sendmail, sm:
If set, do
.I limited
7->8 bit MIME conversions.  These conversions are limited to text/plain data.

.IP a
.I sendmail:
Run ESMTP protocol on the SMTP connection

.I sm: not implemented/used
(See ``B'')
.RI ( SMTP
transport agent's task)

.IP A
.I sendmail:

(Router's task)

.IP b
.I sendmail:
Force a blank line on the end of a message.
(Not needed in
.I sm's
usage environment.)

.I sm:
will activate BSMTP-type wrapping with ``hidden-dot'' algorithm; e.g.
quite ordinary SMTP stream, but in "batch mode".

.IP B
.I sendmail: not defined/used

.I sm:
The first ``\fIB\fR'' turns on similar BSMTP wrapping as ``\fIb\fR'', but
adds SIZE and, if the
.I sm
is started with option
.RI `` \-8 '',
also 8BITMIME options.
The second ``\fIB\fR'' adds there also DSN (Delivery Status Notification)
parameters.

.IP c

.I sm: not implemented/used

.IP C
.I sendmail:
Header address canonicalization

.I sm: not used (router's task)

.IP d
.I sendmail:
Do not include angle brackets around route-address syntax addresses.
(this is broken security trick for some shell script usages, nor recommented!)

.I sm: not implemented/used

.IP D
.I sendmail:
``Date:'' header wanted

.I sm: not used (router's task)

.IP e
.I sendmail:

.I sendmail: not used

.I sm:
Adds ``HELO'' or ``EHLO'' into front of the BSMTP stream.
Normally the BSMTP streams
.B do not
have ``HELO/EHLO'' in front of them to avoid problems with
catenation of BSMTP messages for streamed UUCP transfers, for example.

.IP i
.I sendmail:
Do User Database rewriting on envelope sender address

.I sm: not used (router's task)

.IP I
.I sendmail:

Do
.B not
prepend a From-space line (normal mailbox separator line) to the message.

.IP o
.I sendmail
Always run as the owner of the recipient mailbox

.I sm: meaningless/not used
(ZMailer's
.I sm
is not really for doing local delivery - but see how
.I procmail
is driven.)

.IP O
.I sendmail, sm: Not used

.IP p

Use route-addr style reverse-path in the SMTP ``MAIL FROM:'' command
rather than just the return address.

Strip quote characters (" and \\) off of the addresses before calling
the actual mailer.

.I sm: Not implemented/used.

.IP S
.I sendmail, sm:
will run the delivery program with the same real and effective uid as the
.I sm
process.  If this flag is not set, the delivery program will be run with
the real uid of the

process.  This may be useful if
.I sm
is setuid.

.IP "t, T"
.I sendmail, sm: Not used

.IP u
.I sendmail:
Upper case should be preserved in user names for this mailer.
Standards require preservation of cae in the local part of addresses,
except for those addresses for which your system accepts responsibility.

.I sm: Not used

.IP U
.I sendmail, sm:
will prepend a From-space line, with a "remote from \fImyuucpname\fR" at the

See RFC 2033.

.I sm: Not implemented/used.

.IP Z
.I sendmail, sm: Not used

.PP
The
.I path
field specifies the location of the delivery program.  Relative pathnames
are allowed and are relative to the
.I MAILBIN
directory, but also dollar-expressions of type: ${ZENVAR}
.PP
The
.I arguments
field extends to the end of the line.  It contains whitespace-separated
argv parameters which may contain one of the following sequences:
.IP $g
which is replaced by the sender address.
.IP $h
which is replaced by the destination host.
.IP $u
which is replaced by the recipient address.  If the \-m mailer flag
is set and there are several recipients for this message, the argument
containing the $u will be replicated as necessary for each recipient.
(Also ${ZENVAR} expressions are allowed!)
.SH INTERFACE
This program reads in processable file names relative to the current
working directory of the scheduler (namely: \fI$POSTIOFFICE/transport/\fR).
Optionally on the same line the scheduler may tell which host is to be
looked for from the recipients of the message.
.sp
.nf
	\fIrelative-spool-path\fR [ <TAB> \fIhostname\fR ]
.fi
.PP
This program produces diagnostic output on the standard output.
Normal diagnostic output is of the form:
.sp
.nf
	\fIid\fR/\fIoffset\fR<TAB>\fInotify-data\fR<TAB>\fIstatus\fR \fImessage\fR
.fi
.sp
where 
.I id
is the inode number of the message file,
.I offset
is a byte offset within its control file where the address being reported
on is kept,
.I status
is one of
.BR ok ,
.BR error ,
or
.BR deferred ,
and the
.I message
is descriptive text associated with the report.  The text is terminated by
a linefeed.  Any other format (as might be produced by subprocesses)
is passed to standard output for logging in the
.B scheduler
log.
.PP
The exit status is a code from
.BR <sysexits.h> .
