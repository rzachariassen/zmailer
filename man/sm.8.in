.SH NAME
sm \- zmailer Sendmail compatible transport agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBsm\fR 3em
[\fB\-8HQV\fR]
[\fB\-f\fR\ \fIconfigfile\fR]
\fB\-c\ \fIchannel\fR
\fB\-h\ \fIhost\fR
\fImailer\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sm
is a ZMailer transport agent which is usually only run by the
.IR scheduler (8zm),
to deliver messages by invoking a program with facilities and in a way
compatible with a Sendmail mailer.  The
.I sm
program must be run with the same
current directory as the
.IR scheduler ,
namely \fIPOSTOFFICE\fB/transport\fR.
.PP
The program scans the message control files named on stdin for addresses
destined for the channel and/or the host given on the command line.  If any
are found, all matching addresses and messages are processed according to
the specifications for the
.I mailer
in the configuration file.
.PP
The exit status of a
.I mailer
should be one of the standard values specified in \fB<sysexits.h>\fR.
Of these, \fBEX_OK\fR indicates successful deliver, and
\fBEX_DATAERR\fR, \fBEX_NOUSER\fR, \fBEX_NOHOST\fR, \fBEX_UNAVAILABLE\fR,
and \fBEX_NOPERM\fR indicate permanent failure.  All other exit codes
will be treated as a temporary failure and the delivery will be retried.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-8
tells that the output is 8-bit clean, and for any MIME message with
\fIQUOTED-PRINTABLE\fR encoding the coding can be decoded.
.IP \-Q
tells that the transport channel will likely treat poorly control
characters like TAB, and possibly SPACE too..  This encodes them all
by using \fIQUOTED-PRINTABLE\fR encoding.
.IP \-f\ \fIconfigfile\fR
specifies the name of a configuration file containing specifications of
the various known Sendmail compatible mailer programs: how to invoke them
and how to process messages for them.  The default is \fIMAILSHARE\fB/sm.cf\fR.
.IP \-c\ \fIchannel\fR
specifies which channel name should be keyed on.  There is no default.
If this option is not specified, the \-h option must be.
.IP \-h\ \fIhost\fR
specifies which host name should be keyed on.  There is no default.
If this option is not specified, the \-c option must be.
.IP \-V
prints a version message and exits.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration file associates the
.I mailer
keyword from the command line with a specification of a delivery program.
This is very similar to the way the definition of a mailer in Sendmail
requires flags, a program name, and a command line specification.
These are in fact the fields of the entries of the configuration file.
Lines starting with whitespace or a ``#'' are ignored, and all others are
assumed to follow this format:
.PP
.TS
l l l l
l s
l s
l s
l l l l.
\fImailer	flags	program	argument list\fR

For example:

local	mS	sm/localm	localm -r $g $u
prog	-	/bin/sh	sh -c $u
tty	rs	/usr/local/to	to $u
uucp	U	/usr/bin/uux	uux - -r -a$g -gC $h!rmail ($u)
usenet	m	sm/usenet	usenet $u
ean	mn	/lib/ean/gwsmean	gwsmean -d $u
test	n	sm/test	test $u
smsgw	nS	${MAILBIN}/sms-gw	sms-gw $g $u
.TE
.PP
The
.I mailer
field extends from the beginning of the line to the first whitespace.  It
is used simply as a key index to the configuration file contents.  Whitespace
is used as the field separator for all the fields.
.PP
The
.I flags
field contains a concatenation of one-letter flags.
If no flags are desired, a ``-'' character should be used to
indicate presence of the field.
All normal
.I Sendmail
flags are recognized, but the ones that do not make sense in the context of
.I ZMailer
will produce an error.
.PP
The flags that change the behaviour of
.IR sm (8zm)
and their comparisons against
.I sendmail-8.11
are:

The

field specifies the location of the delivery program.
Relative pathnames are allowed and are relative to the

directory, but also dollar-expressions of type: ${ZENVAR}
.PP
The
.I arguments
field extends to the end of the line.
It contains whitespace-separated argv parameters which may contain
one of the following sequences:
.IP $g
which is replaced by the sender address.
.IP $h
which is replaced by the destination host.
.IP $u
which is replaced by the recipient address.
If the
.B \-m
mailer flag is set and there are several recipients for this message,
the argument containing the
.B $u
will be replicated as necessary for each recipient.
(Also ${ZENVAR} expressions are allowed!)
.SH INTERFACE
This program reads in processable file names relative to the current
working directory of the scheduler (namely: \fI$POSTIOFFICE/transport/\fR).
Optionally on the same line the scheduler may tell which host is to be

where

is one of

or
.BR deferred ,
and the
.I message
is descriptive text associated with the report.  The text is terminated by
a linefeed.
Any other format (as might be produced by subprocesses) is passed
to standard output for logging in the
