.SH DESCRIPTION
This
.IR sendmail (8zm)
program is an emulation of the original Sendmail interface.  It provides all
the original options that it makes sense to support in the context of ZMailer.
This is not intended to be the normal user interface to mail, rather it is
used by old User Agent programs, e.g.,
.IR Mail (1),
to submit mail.  This mechanism has been superseded by the
.IR zmailer (3zm)
library routines as the native submission interface
(Application Program Interface) for ZMailer.
.PP
The default action is to submit the RFC822 format mail message expected
on stdin to the mailer, with the addresses listed on the command line
as recipients.  If there are no recipient addresses specified on the
command line, the mailer will infer them from the message header.  The
sender is the account of the current userid, except for root where the
preferred sender is the account of the current login session.  The message
terminates when a period is seen by itself on a line, or at end of file on
the input stream.
.PP
If the message submission fails immediately on the
.IR mail_open (3zm),
the data on stdin will be appended to a
.B dead.letter
file in the submitters home directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-bm
asks
.I sendmail
to deliver mail, which it does anyway.  This option has no effect.
.IP \-bs
will start an SMTP server reading from stdin.  This causes the
.IR smtpserver (8zm)
program to be executed.
.IP \-bd
starts the
.IR router (8zm)
and
.IR scheduler (8zm)
programs to emulate Sendmail's daemon mode.
This is \fBnot\fR a recommended method
to start these programs, instead use
.IR zmailer (1zm).
.IP \-bt
runs the
.IR router (8zm)
in interactive mode for testing.
.IP \-bi
runs
.IR newaliases (1zm)
to rebuild the alias file database;
This is \fBnot\fR a recommended method
to start these programs, instead use
.I "zmailer newdb"
.IP \-bp
runs
.IR mailq (1zm)
to print the mail transport queue status.
.IP \-C\ \fIconfigfile\fR
specify the
.IR router (8zm)
configuration file.
.IP \-E
indicates the origin of this message is an insecure channel.
This should be used when
.I sendmail
is used to submit messages coming in from outside the local machine, to avoid
security problems during message processing.
This flag ensures the message will have no privileges even if the current
userid is "trusted".
.IP \-f\ \fIaddress\fR
specify the sender address.
This is the default originator address if there is no
.B From:
header in the message.
It becomes the
.B Sender:
address otherwise.
In either case if the current userid is not "trusted" by the mailer,
it is free to ignore both this option and any header information
to ensure properly authenticated originator information.
.IP \-F\ \fIfullname\fR
specify the full name of the (local) sender.
.IP \-i
tells
.I sendmail
to not use a period ('.') on a line by itself as a message terminator, only
the end of file will terminate the message.
.IP \-m
asks the mailer not to ignore the originator in the addressee list.
This is default behaviour, so this option has no effect.
.IP \-oi
is like \-i.
.IP \-oQ\ \fIpostoffice\fR
specifies an alternate
.B POSTOFFICE
directory.
.IP \-q
asks for queue processing.  This option has no effect.
.IP \-r\ \fIaddress\fR
is like \-f.
.IP \-t
scan the RFC-822 headers for recipient addresses in "To:", "Cc:",
and "Bcc:" headers.
The "Bcc:" header will be deleted before processing continues.
Any addresses in the argument list will be ignored.

In case no addresses are given in the argument list, this is the
default operation mode.
.IP \-v
will report the progress of the message after it has been submitted.
The
.I sendmail
process will write verbose log information to the stderr stream until
the
.I scheduler
deletes the message.
.IP \-V\ \fIenvid\fR
sets Delivery-Status-Notification parameter
.I ENVID
to be any arbitary [xtext] string. (Format verified!)
.IP \-N\ \fInotify\fR
sets Delivery-Status-Notification notify parameter to be:
.I NEVER,
or any combination of:
.I SUCCESS, FAILURE, DELAY.
.IP \-R\ \fIretmode\fR
sets Delivery-Status-Notification parameter to be either of:
.I FULL, HDRS.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
.IP ZCONFIG
.RS
This environment variable is expected to be inherited from
caller, and it tells where callers idea of
.IR ZENV -variables
are located at.
.PP
If it isn't present, system compiled defaults will be used.
.PP
If this is present, but bad, you are screwed...
