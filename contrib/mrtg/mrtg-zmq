#
# This is ZMailer queue poller script to produce data poll results
# for the MRTG monitoring grapher utility
#
# This is intended to be run from under inetd(8) with following
# kind of parameter line:
#
#   mrtg-zmq  stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/mrtg-zmq
#
# It obviously needs adding "mrtg-zmq" into /etc/services (or equivalent
# NIS/NIS+ service), plus installing and configuring the TCP-Wrapper.
#
# How to do those is left as an excercise to the reader; the reader
# is assumed to be quite bright when s/he is playing with MRTG.
#
# The output is space separates sequence of tokens -- numbers
# in following order:
#
#  - router queue (by directory scan)
#  - transport queue (by directory scan)
#  - number of scheduler kids
#  - number of idle scheduler kids
#  - number of message files in transporter per scheduler's knowledge
#    (this should equal with transport queue, or be very close!)
#  - number of threads; different destination domains to be sent to
#  - number of recipients; sum of message counts per destinations
#  - Triplets of:
#     - channel/host selector
#     - number of threads (different destination domains)
#     - sum of number of messages in all these group
#
# Only the first seven (7) fields are there always, and the triplets
# may or may not exist, plus their order is somewhat unpredictable.
