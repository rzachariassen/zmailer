	For running PROCMAIL as your local delivery agent:


You need to modify/verify three (3) files:

	$MAILSHARE/router.cf:
	$MAILSHARE/scheduler.conf:
	$MAILSHARE/sm.conf:


In the router configuration there is a parameter, which controls on
how the local addresses look when rewritten:

------ $MAILSHARE/router.cf:
  # Does our "local" channel accept domain (@) at the user part ?
  # ZMailer's mailbox does accept.  If you use something else, and
  # it doesn't accept, comment this away!
  
< localdoesdomain=1
> #localdoesdomain=1
------


In the scheduler configuration we must leave clauses for "local/file*",
and "local/pipe*" in front of "local/*" intact, as they handle things
that procmail can not do by itself.  Then we continue by modifying the
"local/*" clause to choose proper command:

------ $MAILSHARE/scheduler.conf:
  local/*
	interval=5m
	idlemax=9m
	# Originally we had 3 hour expiry, but if your local system goes to
	# a fizz (freezes, that is), your local mail may start to bounce
	# before anybody notices anything...
	expiry=3d
	# want 20 channel slots, but only one HOST
	maxchannel=15
	maxring=5
	#
	# Do MIME text/plain; Quoted-Printable -> text/plain; 8BIT
	# conversion on flight!
<	command="mailbox -8"
>	#command="mailbox -8"
	# Or with CYRUS server the following might do:
	#command="sm -8c $channel cyrus"
	# Or with PROCMAIL as the local delivery agent:
<	#command="sm -8c $channel procm"
>	command="sm -8c $channel procm"
-------

And lastly, the sm configuration needs to be made sure it has specfication
for "procm" so that "sm" knows what it needs to do, and where your procmail
program is:

------- $MAILSHARE/sm.conf:
procm	sSPfn	/usr/local/bin/procmail		procmail -a $h -d $u
#		# Procmail example from: Ken Pizzini <ken@spry.com>
-------


These work with earlier versions of ZMailer too, provided that the router
scripts recognize messages destined to files/pipes, and provides special
versions for the "host" part of the address quad; namely "file." and "pipe."
prefixes.
