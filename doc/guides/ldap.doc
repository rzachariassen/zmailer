Hi all,

Finally, I wrote my LDAP router db module.  It tested with 2.99.48 and I
think it shouldn't have any problem with latest version if no API is changed.

With the module compiled, you can define your LDAP search query in a config
file.   Here's one that I am currently testing.

---- $MAILSHARE/db/fullnames.ldap ------------------------------------------
#
# You must at least define "base", "ldaphost", "filter" & "attr".
#
base		o=HKUST,c=HK
ldaphost	ldap.ust.hk
ldapport	389
binddn		cn=Directory Manager,o=HKUST,c=HK
passwd		secret
filter		(&(objectclass=person)(mailAlternateAddress=%s))
attr		uid
scope		sub
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And then defined your relation DB in .cf file.

relation -mt ldap -f $MAILSHARE/db/fullnames.ldap fullnamemap

It supports the -m flag such that it will re-read the configuration if the
config file changed.  Also, the search filter is a "sprintf" style
string that defines how the key is.  It MUST be of the form "(attribute=%s)".
It should define a search that return AT MOST one entry & single attribute
value.  If not, the map will only use the first entry and first attribute it
received.

In case of server or network error that the map failed to lookup,  the mail
message will be deferred and hold with DEFER_IO_ERROR.

Mea,  I haven't integrated this module into autoconfig as I don't know 
enough how to do it :(  Can you or anyone help to put it altogether?   It 
should compile well either with UM ldap 3.3 or Netscape Directory SDK 1.0.
