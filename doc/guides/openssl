	Use OpenSSL to create RFC 2487 services

Adapted from material at:
  http://www.aet.tu-cottbus.de/personen/jaenicke/pfixtls/

Here are steps to add OpenSSL to the ZMailer smtpserver:

A)  OpenSSL library:
 1) Pick source via  www.openssl.org;  MINIMUM LEVEL: 0.9.3a
    (that is what I used..)

 2) Compile that system with default prefix:
	./config --prefix=/usr/local/ssl

 3) make, test, install, etc..

B)  ZMailer:
 1) Configure with new additional option:
	--with-openssl-prefix=/usr/local/ssl

 2) Compile and install like always

 3) Obtain, or generate the server certificate and private key,
    and install them into  "$MAILVAR/db/smtpserver-cert.pem", and
    "$MAILVAR/db/smtpserver-key.pem"; latter of which must *not*
    use password encryption, and likely should be owned by ROOT,
    and with permission of 0400 !
    Oh, you will also need CAcert.pem file...

    For a document about being your own CA supplying the certificate(s):

http://www.aet.tu-cottbus.de/personen/jaenicke/pfixtls/doc/myownca.html


    That generated certificate must be *SERVER* certificate!
    At  openssl.cnf  file following must be enabled when
    creating this certificate:
		# This is OK for an SSL server.
		nsCertType			= server
    (you may need to do some searching to find that file)

    To summarize the command sequence:

	0.0) Run CA.pl  at where-ever your CA subsystem resides
	     (it uses *relative* paths -- the ``CA'' goes into
	      ``demoCA'' subdirectory of that directory..)

	0.1) Create your CA with ``CA.pl -newca'' command
	     - Define CA password which you WILL remember.

	1)   Create server certificate: ``CA.pl -newcert''
	     (plus preceding comment about  openssl.cnf  file.)

	2)   Sign the server certificate: ``CA.pl -signcert''
	     Here you will need the CA password

    If the run-location is your home directory, and OpenSSL is in
    the default setup, you will now pick following files:

	~/demoCA/cacert.pem	->  smtpserver-CAcert.pem
	~/newreq.pem		->  smtpserver-key.pem
	~/newcert.pem		->  smtpserver-cert.pem


 4) The  $MAILVAR/smtpserver.conf  will need PARAMs:

#
# TLSv1/SSLv[23] parameters; all must be used for the system to work!
#
PARAM	use-tls
PARAM	tls-CAfile	@MAILVAR@/db/smtpserver-CAcert.pem
PARAM	tls-cert-file	@MAILVAR@/db/smtpserver-cert.pem
PARAM	tls-key-file	@MAILVAR@/db/smtpserver-key.pem
#  # Actually these last two default each other, so only one must be given
#  # Then some futher thoughs that may materialize some time..
##PARAM tls-CApath ... (somewhen: ways to verify client's certificates)
##PARAM tls-loglevel	0
##PARAM tls-enforce-tls	1
##PARAM tls-ccert-vd	1






  Explanations follow:


Because the TLS related code is fairly straight copy from Postfix
specific one, the document is fairly direct copy too..

# To use TLS we do need a certificate and a private key. Both must be in
# "pem" format, the private key must not be encrypted, that does mean:
# it must be accessable without password. Both parts (certificate and
# private key) may be in the same file.
#
# tls-cert-file = /etc/postfix/server.pem
# tls-key-file  = /etc/postfix/server.pem

# The certificate was issued by a certification authority (CA), of which
# the CA-cert must be available. This file may also contain the the
# CA certificates of other trusted CAs. You must use this file for the
# list of trusted CAs if you want to use chroot-mode.
#
# tls-CAfile = /etc/postfix/CAcert.pem

# To verify the peer certificate, we need to know the certificates of
# certification authorities. These certificates in "pem" format are
# collected in a directory. The same CAs are offered to clients for
# client verification. Don't forget to create the necessary "hash"
# links with $OPENSSL_HOME/bin/c_rehash /etc/postfix/certs. A typical
# place for the CA-certs may also be $OPENSSL_HOME/certs, so there is
# no default and you explicitly have to set the value here!
#
# tls-CApath = /etc/postfix/certs

# To get additional information during the TLS setup and negotiations
# you can increase the loglevel from 0..4:
# 0: No output about the TLS subsystem
# 1: Printout startup and certificate information
# 2: 1 + Printout of levels during negotiation
# 3: 2 + Hex and ASCII dump of negotiation process
# 4: 3 + Hex and ASCII dump of complete transmission after STARTTLS
# Use loglevel 3 only in case of problems. Use of loglevel 4 is strongly
# discouraged.
#
# tls-loglevel = 0

# By default TLS is disabled, so no difference to plain postfix is visible.
# Explicitely switch it on here:
#
# use-tls
