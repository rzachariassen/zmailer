	configure  options of ZMailer package, per version 2.99.50s17


The  configure  script has three kinds of parameters for it:
	- (optional) environment variables for CC="..." et.al.
	- ZENV data pulled in from $ZCONFIG file (if it exists)
	- various  --with-*  et.al. options


Used environment variables:

	ZCONFIG="/file/path"
		Using this is alternate for using "--with-zconfig=.."
		option.  Not needed if the default of /etc/zmailer.conf
		is used.
	CC="command"
	CFLAGS="options"
		Obvious ones, compiler, and possible "-g -O" flags...
	CPPDEP="command"
		Not normally needed -- builds dependencies
	INEWSBIN=/file/path
		If you want to pre-define where your 'inews' program
		is -- for possible use of 'usenet' channel.

Recycled ZENV variables (from $ZCONFIG file):

	For these see  SiteConfig(.in)  file

	ZCONFIG=
	MAILBOX=
	POSTOFFICE=
	MAILSHARE=
	MAILVAR=
	MAILBIN=
	LOGDIR=
	NNTPSERVER=
	SCHEDULEROPTIONS=
	ROUTEROPTIONS=
	SMTPOPTIONS=
	LOGDIR=
	SENDMAILPATH=
	RMAILPATH=
	SELFADDRESSES=

Options:

	Options for various facilities:

	--prefix=/DIR/PATH
		The only really mandatory option, gives actually
		defaults for MAILSHARE/MAILVAR/MAILBIN.

	--with-gcc
		Compile with GCC even when you have "cc" around.

	--with-generic-include="-I/..."
		Include option for local overriders; some things may
		be installed into e.g. /usr/local/include, and the
		system compiler won't check that without this...

	--with-zconfig=/FILE/PATH
		Where the runtime   zmailer.conf   file is located
		at (and with what name).  This is ONLY hard-coded
		info within libraries and thus programs using them.
		Everything else is runtime relocatable by means of
		using "variables" listed in this file.

		Default: /etc/zmailer.conf

	--with-mailbox=/DIR/PATH
		Overrides system-dependent location of the user mail-
		boxes.  Defaults are looked up thru list of directories:
		   /var/mail /var/spool/mail /usr/mail /usr/spool/mail
		First found directory will be the default -- or then
		system yields  /usr/spool/mail

	--with-postoffice=/DIR/PATH
		Overrides system-dependent location of the "postoffice"
		directory under which system stores queued email.
		Will try directories /{usr,var}/spool/postoffice/ to
		see, if previously installed directory tree exists.
		Default will be  /var/spool/postoffice/ in case there
		is no previously created postoffice directory.

	--with-mailshare=/DIR/PATH
	--with-mailvar=/DIR/PATH
	--with-mailbin=/DIR/PATH
		These are overrides for values derived from  --prefix=/DIR
		option.  MAILSHARE = "$PREFIX", MAILVAR = "$PREFIX", but
		the last is MAILBIN = "$PREFIX/bin"

	--with-logdir=/DIR/PATH
		Explicite value to replace $LOGDIR ZENV value and/or to
		override default value of:  /var/log/mail

	--with-nntpserver=HOST
		If you want to use 'usenet' channel, you need to name
		NNTP server into which you feed news with NNTP.

	--with-sendmailpath=/FILE/PATH
		Overrider for default location(s) of sendmail program.
		ZENV variable SENDMAILPATH can be overridden with this.

	--with-rmailpath=/FILE/PATH
		Overrider for default location(s) of rmail program.
		ZENV variable RMAILPATH can be overridden with this.

	--with-selfaddresses="NAME,NAME"
		Obsolete option regarding providing into in ZENV variable
		to yield system internal names automagically for the SMTP
		transport channel uses, and also for the router to see,
		if destination IP address is local at the system.

	--with-system-malloc
		Use system malloc() library, don't compile own!
		Alternate for using: --with-libmalloc=system
		This is default.

	--with-libmalloc=LIBNAME
		"LIBNAME" is one of:
		- "system"
			System malloc() as is.
		- "malloc"
			Bundled "libmalloc" without debugging things.
		- "malloc_d"
			Bundled "libmalloc" WITH debugging things.

	--with-yp
		Want to use YP, has it at default locations

	--with-yp-lib='-L... -lyp'
		If needed to define linking-time options to find the YP-
		library.

	--with-ldap-prefix=DIRPREFIX
		If UMich/NetScape LDAP are available thru DIRPREFIX/include/
		and DIRPREFIX/lib/ locations, this is a short-hand to find
		the interface -- with files in the system primary include
		and lib locations,  "/usr" is a special value which will be
		ignored.  No default value for DIRPREFIX.

	--with-ldap-include-dir=/DIR/PATH
		Special overrider for compilation include directory of LDAP

	--with-ldap-library-dir=/DIR/PATH
		Special overrider for linkage library directory of LDAP

	--without-fsync
		At systems where the local filesystem is log-based/journaling,
		doing   fsync()  is wastefull.  This disables fsync() in
		cases where it is not needed.    (In others it may boost
		your system performance by about 20% -- with dangers..
		On the other hand, recently a system disk(?) fault which
		hang mailer at spool directory access did cause severe
		damage all over, and probably use of this option would
		not have made any difference..  fsck was mighty unhappy..)

	--with-bundled-libresolv
		If your system is not very modern, you may consider using
		this option to compile in a resolver from bind-4.9.4-REL.
		On the other hand, if your system is modern, it may have
		even newer resolver in it.  At such time, don't use this!

	--with-ipv6
		Use IPv6 at things where it is supported.  This is often
		highly experimental, although many subsystems in ZMailer
		are built with   getnameinfo()  et.al. interfaces, which
		works both on IPv4 and IPv6.

	--with-ipv6-replacement-libc
		If the system needs more support for user-space IPv6
		things, this generates those.  OR IF THE EXISTING USER-
		SPACE IPv6 SUPPORT IS BUGGY LIKE AT GNU LIBC 2.0/2.1/2.2!

	--without-rfc822-tabs
		Some systems dislike getting RFC-822 headers with form of:
			"Headername: <TAB> value"
		With this option, no TABs are used and instead "ordinary"
		space character is used.

	--with-tcp-wrappers[=/DIR/PATH]
		Optional  =/DIR/PATH  value gives directory where there are
		<tcpd.h>  and  libwrap.a  files.
		Without value this option looks for several common locations
		for those files, and if finds them, yields compile and linking
		hooks,

	--with-ta-mmap
		Some systems with good mmap() with MAP_FILE|MAP_SHARED,
		and well behaving  munmap()  it does make sense to replace
		read()/write() thru a file-descriptor to the file with
		mmap() -- however that requires munmap() NOT TO scrub
		away in-mapped any more actively, than the buffer-cache
		works at read()/write() blocks.

		This was default for a while, however most systems don't
		have really well-behaved munmap()s :-/
		(Perhaps IBM AIX is the only exception ?)

	--with-whoson[=/DIR/PATH]
		In the  contrib/ directory there is ``whoson-*.tar.gz''
		server package which may be of interest to you in case
		you need to allow easy (to users) access for relaying
		to your users from where-ever they are traveling.  When
		that daemon is installed, and the pop/imap servers are
		patched to use it, a successfull message-store retrieve
		operation (login to do it) can open otherwise restricted
		relaying to user's IP address for a configurable time.

		This option may be needed to tell the directory, or a
		prefix to "include" and "lib" subdirectories, at which
		the ``whoson-*.tar.gz'' client include and library files
		are stored at.

	--with-getpwnam-library="-L.. -l.."
		Linking options for non-std getpwnam() libraries; these
		are used at smtpserver, and at mailbox programs.

	--with-openssl-prefix=/dir/path (defines both include and lib)
	--with-openssl-include=/dir/incl/path
	--with-openssl-lib=/dir/lib/path
		If you want to use OpenSSL; see  doc/guides/openssl

	--with-privateauth
		Use "private/" in a part of smtpserver program module
		compilations. (Specifically: zpwmatch.c)

	--with-privatembox
		Use "private/" in a part of mailbox program module
		compilarions. (Specifically: sieve.c)
