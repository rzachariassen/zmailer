Database creation command:  relation

SYNTAX:
	relation -t dbtype [-f file -e# -s# -blnu -d driver] name

    Options are listed below. "name" is name of the relation
    that is wanted to be created.  Examples:

	relation -t bind,mx  mxhost
	relation -t ordered -f $MAILVAR/db/routes routes
	relation -t ordered -b -f /usr/lib/news/active.sorted newsgroups


OPTIONS:
Key handling:
	-l			Map all keys to lower case
	-u			Map all keys to upper case
Post processing
	-b			Boolean postprocessor
	-i			Indirect reference post-processor
	-n			Ensure non-null return value postprocessor
	-p			Pathalias postprocessor
Others:
	-d driver-routine	Knows driver routines:
					pathalias
					pathalias.nodot
	-f file.name		Defines file name
	-m			Do modification check on database every
				time it is accessed.
	-s cache_size		Numeric for cache size (entries)
	-t database-type[,subtype]
				It knows about following database types:
		incore
		header		Message headers.
		ordered		File must be sorted into ascending ASCII order.
				(Does binary search.)
		unordered	File can be in any order (Does linear search).
		bind		DNS query interface
		ndbm		When the BSD NDBM is available
		gdbm		When the GNU GDBM is available
		dbm		When only old SysV DB is available
		btree		When the BSD B-Tree database is available
		bhash		When the BSD HASH database is available
		yp		When Sun YP (a.k.a. NIS) is available
		ldap		When LDAP is available
	-e time-to-live		Default cache data expiration time (seconds)

NOTES:
	On systems with USE_MMAP the  ordered and unordered databases
	are r/o mapped into memory, and for ordered case, a special
	line-index is generated for speeding up the binary search.
	(Makes less system calls that way..)
