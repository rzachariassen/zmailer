    Another way is described at  'smtp-etrn'  file.

A possible way to do it:

Define explicite routes for all target systems, including
default "." route.

$MAILVAR/db/routes:

	host1.local.dom   smtpx!host1.local.dom
	host2.local.dom   smtpx!host2.local.dom
	.                 smtpx!outbound.relay.dom


$MAILSHARE/scheduler.conf:

	smtpx/outbound.relay.dom
		queueonly	# since 2.99.49p5 (July 25, 1997)
		#(+ other parms)
		command="smtp -c smtpx -x"
	smtpx/*
		# NO queueonly HERE!
		command="smtp -c smtpx -x"


Now these mean that all your non-local traffic will go
to a non-automatically kicked queue, and you have to
manually initiate a "ETRN outbound.relay.dom" operation
on it every now and then..
