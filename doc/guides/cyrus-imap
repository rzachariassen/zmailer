I am not native English writer either, so don't look at me ;-)


------------- ZMailer to Cyrus Micro-HOWTO ----------------

=============
Zmailer/LMTP integration for local delivery.


 Zmailer starting from version 2.99.55 has a ability to
 deliver local e-mail via AF_UNIX LMTP socket.


1. LMTP Server

You should have LMTP (RFC 2033) server running on
AF_UNIX (AF_LOCAL) socket on your system.
 
For example, to start Cyrus-IMAP listening on AF_UNIX
socket you should add a line to the main Cyrus configfile
(i.e. /etc/cyrus.conf)

=========
# UNIX sockets start with a slash and are put into /var/lib/imap/sockets
SERVICES {
....
  # at least one LMTP is required for delivery
  #lmtp         cmd="lmtpd" listen="lmtp" prefork=0
  lmtpunix      cmd="lmtpd" listen="/var/lib/imap/socket/lmtp" prefork=1
...
}
========

NOTE: The Cyrus-IMAP has a `deliver` utility. This is just a
"frontend" to the LMTP socket.

Due to RFC 2033 "The LMTP protocol SHOULD NOT be used over
wide area networks.". Cyrus-IMAP can to do this, but you MUST
be authenticated as Cyrus-Admin user. Otherwise, AF_UNIX LMTP
socket does not requres any user authentifiaction.


 To "telnet" to this socket you could use latest version of
`netcat` (or `nc`) utility :
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/nc/

# netcat -U /var/lib/imap/socket/lmtp

2. Zmailer configuration.

In  $MAILSHARE/router.cf  there is the need to run WITHOUT qualifying
local addresses.
 ------ 
   # Does our "local" channel accept domain (@) at the user part ?
   # ZMailer's mailbox does accept.  If you use something else, and
   # it doesn't accept, comment this away!
   
 - localdoesdomain=1
 + #localdoesdomain=1
 ------

Another thing in that   router.cf   is to have these lines (changed
or added) in near its top (right after preceding fragment):

 ------
   # If there shall NOT be  $MAILVAR/fqlists/  directory lookups
   # in address resolving, uncomment following:
 - #nofqlists=1
 + nofqlists=1
 ------


In  scheduler.conf  file for   local/*   target, select the last
of the CYRUS specific entries, disable all other "command=" lines
in the subset, and edit UNIX:-path to match your application.

 ----- scheduler.conf  fragment for  local/*  target -------
   # Or with CYRUS server the following might do:
   #command="sm -c $channel cyrus"
   #command="smtp -c $channel -M -x -F [127.0.0.1] -p 2525 -s" # -l ${LOGDIR}/smtp-lmtp"
   command="smtp -c $channel -M -x -F UNIX:/var/lib/imap/socket/lmtp -s -l ${LOGDIR}/smtp-lmtp"
 ----------------

An alternate processing way would be thru using  'smtp-lmtp/*' channel
setup in  scheduler.conf,  and placing the above given  command=  line
also in there to be the active one.  Observe relevant comments further
below in routing database discussions.
(Do note that although the SMTP client has ability to do  AUTH LOGIN
in SMTP session, that isn't verified to function.)


As the system doesn't use UNIX accounts (and homedirs) for anything,
Doing fully qualifying routing for the addresses will be a challenge.
One way to do it is to use following maps in   $MAILVAR/db/dbases.conf
file:

 aliases         $DBTYPE 0:0:644    -la $MAILVAR/db/aliases-local -lm
 aliases         $DBTYPE 0:0:644    -r $MAILVAR/db/aliases      -lm -C $MAILVAR/db/sleepyenv.conf
 fqdnaliases     $DBTYPE root:0:644 -la $MAILVAR/db/fqdnaliases-local  -lm%
 fqdnaliases     $DBTYPE root:0:644 -r $MAILVAR/db/fqdnaliases  -lm% -C $MAILVAR/db/sleepyenv.conf
 fqdnroutes      $DBTYPE root:0:644 -l $MAILVAR/db/fqdnroutes-local -lm%:
 fqdnroutes      $DBTYPE root:0:644 -r $MAILVAR/db/fqdnroutes  -lm%: -C $MAILVAR/db/sleepyenv.conf

 routesdb        $DBTYPE -   -l  $MAILVAR/db/routes      -lm%:d pathalias
 thishost        $DBTYPE -   -l  $MAILVAR/db/localnames  -lm%d  pathalias

The  'sleepyenv.conf'  file referred above is intended to be something 
like:

 -------
 #
 # SleepyCat DB 3/4 environment settings
 #
 
 envhome  = /var/mail/db
 envmode  = 0600
 envflags = CDB, CREATE, RO
 -------

Now these files with the  'sleepyenv.conf' in them are peculiar; they are
READ-ONLY for 'newdbprocessor', but are read/write for the 'router'.
In this example it is special "SleepyCat DB  Concurrent Database"  mode
local database, which can be updated live by means of external updater
program (*).  These could be also e.g. an LDAP maps, but for various
reasons this author has always preferred local databases over network
accessed ones, when having to rely on unknown quality DB access APIs.
(This is about needing to know for sure that the key does not exist in
the database, and not merely having problems accessing the database..
"sendmail + NIS"  is a sad example of lack of this distinction.)

*) The local access databases as ZMailer them uses do expect to have
C-string ending NUL-chars in their keys, and lookup results!


And following setup of database contents (by their base filenames):

  In  'localnames':
      List only local system name, NOT its service domains,
      or anything else!

  In  'smtp-policy.relay':
      List all domains that are serviced within this system
      (it will be a major pain to introduce new domains automatically
       thru this, though!  This file is used to control smtpserver's
       idea about locally serviced domains in addition to those listed
       in 'localnames' file, and is processed into local static database
       by means of  $MAILBIN/policy-builder.sh  script.)

      If this file is managed (produced) by the system management
      software, then 'smtp-policy.relay.manual' can be used to add
      domains outside that software's control.

  In  'routesdb':
      For every locally serviced domain, have a failover entry:
          locally.known.domain   error!nosuchuser
      or:
          locally.known.domain   error!nosuchuser!some explanation text

      (There could be similar 'routesdb-local' and 'routesdb' pair
       as is for actual online databases, or just mere text edited
       databases that management software produces.  Refer to the
       'smtp-policy.relay' above!)

  In  'aliases-local':
      Forwards for 'root', et.al. _just_in_case_
  In  'aliases':
      This isn't actually intended to be used in this case.

  In  'fqdnaliases-local':
      Map FQDN-address-forms to their actual addresses; this file should
      handle things like  postmaster  addresses:
          postmaster@locally.known.domain:  actual_postmaster@address

  In  'fqdnaliases':
      This is map of email addresses in locally serviced domains
      to their Cyrus IMAP Message Store userids:
          example.user@locally.known.domain:  fg56778

      This has a problem of using non-qualified local parts as
      intermediate delivery addresses.  Alternate way is to use
      'fqdnroutes' further below.

  In  'fqdnroutes-local':
      This map can be used to make things similar to those of
      'fqdnaliases-local', but sending message to an alternate
      destination:
          user@domain:  smtp-lmtp!cyrus-gw-node!cyrus-user%2

      With the  smtp-lmtp/*  running thru a UNIX socket, the
      middle part will be ignored.  The '%2' is magic for this
      particular mapping that translates   user+tail@domain
      into:  cyrus-user+tail  form.  Also: user--tail@domain
      does get the exact same treatment, but goes thru a lot
      more websites...

  In  'fqdnroutes':
      This is just a SleepyCat DB in a CDB mode with same purpose
      as 'fqdnroutes-local' has.
