\subsection{Checking the Log Files}

Start ZMailer:
\nopagebreak

\vbox{
\begin{alltt}\medskip\hrule\medskip
 $MAILBIN/zmailer
\medskip\hrule\end{alltt}\medskip
}


Keep an eye on the log files ({\tt \$LOGDIR/router}, {\tt \$LOGDIR/scheduler}),
the {\tt \$POSTOFFICE/postman/} directory for malformed message files,
and {\tt \$POSTOFFICE/deferred/} in case of resource problems.


\subsection{Trimdown of Logging}

Once satisfied that things appear to work, you may want to trim down
logging: there are 4 kinds of logging to deal with:
\begin{itemize}
\item router logs, usually kept in {\tt \$LOGDIR/router}.  This is the stdout
and stderr output of the router daemon.  If you wish to turn it off,
invoke router with a {\tt -L/dev/null} option, i.e. change the zmailer
script.  Alternatively, modify the {\tt log()} function in the
configuration file, or its invocations.

*** NOTE, THIS IS INCORRECT INFO, see  \$MAILSHARE/cf/standard.cf for
*** routine   dribble(),  and especially its invocations!
\item scheduler logs, usually kept in {\tt \$LOGDIR/scheduler}.  Same as router.
\item general mail logs, usually kept in syslog files, depending on how
you have configured the syslog utility ({\tt /etc/syslog.conf}).  All
ZMailer programs log using the LOG\_MAIL facility code for normal
messages.  You can deal with this specifically in your {\tt syslog}
configuration file on systems with a 4.3bsd-based syslog.  The
following reflects the recommended configuration on SunOS 4.0:
\begin{alltt}\medskip\hrule\medskip
mail.crit   /var/log/syslog
mail.debug  /var/log/mail
\medskip\hrule\medskip\end{alltt}

For pre-4.3bsd-based syslogs, you may want the syslog log file
to be just for important messages (e.g. LOG\_NOTICE and higher
priority), and have a separate file for informational messages
(LOG\_DEBUG and up).
\item By default, the postmaster will receive a copy of all bounced
mail; this can be turned off selectively by simply editing the
various canned forms used to create the error messages.  These
forms are located in the FORMSDIR ({\tt proto/forms} in the distribution,
or {\tt \$MAILSHARE/forms} when installed).  You should review these
in any case to make sure the text is appropriate for your site.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Scheduler Statistics log}

The  statistics log reports condenced performance oriented
information in following format:
\begin{alltt}\medskip\scriptsize\hrule\medskip
timestamp fileid  dt1 dt2 state $channel/$host
812876190 90401-2   0   5    ok usenet/-
812876228 90401-1   0   7    ok usenet/-
812876244 90401-1   0   1    ok local/gopher-admin
812876244 90401-1   0   5    ok smtp/funet.fi
812876559 90401-1   0  21    ok smtp/utu.fi
\medskip\hrule\end{alltt}\medskip

where the fields are:
\begin{description}
\item[timestamp] \mbox{} \\
The original spoolfile {\tt ctime} (creation time)  stamp
in decimal.

\item[fileid] \mbox{} \\
Spoolfile name after the router has processed it.

\item[dt1] \mbox{} \\
The time difference from spoolfile ctime to 
scheduler control file creation by the router.

\item[dt2] \mbox{} \\
The time difference from scheduler file {\tt ctime} to
the delivery that is logged on.

\item[state] \mbox{} \\
What happened?  Values: {\tt ok}, {\tt error}, {\tt expiry}

\item[\$channel-\$host] \mbox{} \\
Where/how it was processed.

\end{description}


\subsection{syslogged log formats}

At {\em syslog} facility the system logs also material, if it has so been
configured.

Different subsystems do different logs, they are described below.

\subsubsection{Smtpserver's Syslog Format}

The {\em smtpserver} may log in multiple formats:
\begin{description}
\item[\em INFO: connection from ...]
\item[\em WARN: refusing connection from ...]
\item[\em INFO: accepted id ... into freeze..]
\item[\em INFO: TASPID accepted from...] \mbox{} \\

The ta-spool-id -- A spool-id that is valid throughout message lifetime.

\item[\rm EMERG: smtpserver policy database problem...]
\item[\rm ERR:  MAILBIN unspecified in zmailer.conf]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Router's Syslog Format}

The {\em router} does syslog in following format:

{\tt taspid: from=&lt;addr&gt;, rrelay=smtprelay, size=nnn, nrcpts=nnn, msgid=str}

\begin{description}
\item[taspid] \mbox{} \\

The ta-spool-id -- A spool-id that is valid throughout message lifetime

\item[from=] \mbox{} \\

What is the envelope source address

\item[rrelay=] \mbox{} \\

What the message ``rcvdfrom'' envelope header reports.

\item[size=] \mbox{} \\

Total message size in bytes (envelope+headers+body)

\item[nrcpts=] \mbox{} \\

Number of recipients for this message

\item[msgid=] \mbox{} \\

The ``Message-ID:'' header content

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Transport Agent's Syslog Format}

The transport agents log in following format:

{\tt taspid: to=&lt;addr&gt;, delay=dd, xdelay=xx, mailer=mm, relay=rr (wtt), stat=\%s msg}

Here the fields are:
\begin{description}
\item[taspid] \mbox{} \\

The ta-spool-id -- A spool-id that is valid throughout message lifetime

\item[to=] \mbox{} \\

Destination address in whatever form the transport agent uses.

\item[delay=] \mbox{} \\

Delay from message arrival to the system to this logging moment

\item[xdelay=] \mbox{} \\

Delay during this processing attempt -- tells how much time {\em this}
time was spent to process the message.

\item[mailer=] \mbox{} \\

Tells what ``channel'' was used.

\item[relay=] \mbox{} \\

Reports on which host the message is relayed thru (``wtthost''), and for
SMTP, also (in parenthesis) what was the relay's IP address.

\item[stat=] \mbox{} \\

What status was achieved: {\tt ok}, {\tt delayed}, {\tt failed}...
{\bf\Large CHECK!}

\item[msg] \mbox{} \\

Arbitary text line from whatever system is out there.
