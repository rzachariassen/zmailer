<SECT1 ID="build.environment"><TITLE>Environment Issues</>

<PARA>
The cornerstone of everything in busy Internet email routing
is a well-working DNS server, and modern resolver library.
If you use the BIND nameserver, you should be using (or install)
a recent version, at least BIND 4.8. In this package there is also 
a bundled resolver from  bind-4.9.4, however it is a bit difficult
at BSD systems (because those developers use BSD themselves, and
make an assumption that verybody has their version of things...
On the other hand, those systems have reasonably modern resolvers,
so no need to worry about it -- I hope.) 
</PARA>

<PARA>
For performance reasons you should have <EMPHASIS>local</> instance of
nameserver. <EMPHASIS>Even when you don't have any DNS zone data to
originate yourself, an instance of nameserver is able to cache
replies it receives from the network, and thus be able to faster
yield replies for repeated questions.</EMPHASIS>
</PARA>

<PARA>
You may also choose to use ``<APPLICATION>whoson</>'' services provided by
a utility package at ``<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">contrib/</>'' subdirectory.
If you do, then do install that before configuring and installing the ZMailer.
</PARA>

<PARA>
This system uses several preferably separate partitions for
different things:

</ITEMIZEDLIST>
</PARA>

<PARA>
The <APPLICATION>GNU autoconfig</> mechanism is used, however, you
still may need to touch on some files after that system has run through:
You MUST define <OPTION>--prefix=</> so that ZMailer components end up
in reasonable places.  The <FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/</>
(and <FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILSHARE</>/</>, and
 <FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILVAR</>/</>)
variable values are derived from the <OPTION>--prefix=</>, which can
cause surprises if you do <COMMAND>make install</> with
<APPLICATION>GNU autoconfig</> defaults.
</PARA>

<PARA>
When choosing your prefix, do try to keep is fairly short, as
there are a few scripts which catenate string-components of:%
<SCREEN>
  "#! "+prefix+"/bin/router -f"
</SCREEN>
and usually systems have a limit of 32 characters for that,
which gives at most 15 characters for your prefix!
</PARA>

<PARA>
Also, if the <FILENAME>/etc/zmailer.conf</> file exists,
<FOOTNOTE><PARA>Default location is <FILENAME>/etc/zmailer.conf</>,
and it can be changed with <OPTION>--with-zmailer-conf=</> option.
</PARA></FOOTNOTE>
it is read to initialize several different environment paths (including
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/</>, et.al.!)

<SCREEN>
<PROMPT>#</> <USERINPUT>./configure                             \

<PARA>
Or an example from my development machine:
<SCREEN>
  <PROMPT>$ </><USERINPUT>./configure --prefix=/opt/mail</>
  creating cache ./config.cache
  ***
  *** You can set  ZCONFIG  environment variable to define
  *** the location of the (default) /etc/zmailer.conf -file
  *** (You can use also   --with-zconfig=  -parameter)
  ***
  *** Consider also setting following parameters:
  ***   --mandir=DIR     -- for man-pages
  ***   --libdir=DIR     -- for libzmailer(3)
  ***   --includedir=DIR -- for libzmailer(3)
  *** (They can be outside the --prefix=DIR -tree)
  ***
  *** You can set CC, and CFLAGS  environment variables to
  *** choose the C-compiler, and its options, especially at
  *** systems where there are multiple choices to use...
  ***
</SCREEN>
</PARA>

<PARA>
You can also go into a subdirectory, and configure and
compile there: (But it may need <APPLICATION>GNU make</>
as system ``<COMMAND>make</>''!)
<SCREEN>
  <PROMPT>$ </><USERINPUT>mkdir myhost ; cd myhost</>
  <USERINPUT>../configure ...</>
  <USERINPUT>make </>...
</SCREEN>
</PARA>

<PARA>
See if <FILENAME>SiteConfig</> makes sense now, if not, you can tune
most of the values with various <OPTION>--with-*=</> keywords:
<SCREEN>
  <PROMPT>$ </><USERINPUT>./configure --help</>
</SCREEN>
Explanations about these configuration options are listed
at chapter <XREF LINKEND="zins.configure-options-list">.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Those options that you can't tune, you can edit at
the ``<FILENAME>SiteConfig.in</>'' file.
(Redo the configure with new parameters, if that looks
 to be necessary approach.)

<SECT1><TITLE>Installing and Upgrading</TITLE>

<PARA>
This section describes how to install or upgrade ZMailer.
</PARA>

<SECT2><TITLE>Install Preparation</TITLE>
<!-- \index{build!install/upgrade preparation}\index{installation!prepatations of,}  -->

<PARA>
If you are currently running a zmailer, kill off all mailer processes
using
<SCREEN>
  <PROMPT>$ </><USERINPUT>zmailer kill</>
</SCREEN>
and save the state of your system.  This includes any active contents
of the <FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>POSTOFFICE</>/</>, as well
as database files and anything else in the installation areas you want
to be sure to keep.
This is just paranoia, the installation should not overwrite precious
files, and will save old versions of distribution files in
``<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">bak/</>'' subdirectories.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The interface in between the commonly used sendmail, and ZMailer
is a ``compability program'', which is to replace the
<FILENAME>/usr/lib/sendmail</FILENAME>
(aka <FILENAME>/usr/sbin/sendmail</> on some systems).
The system attempts to automate the replacement, but it <EMPHASIS>may</>
present a cry for help if your system does not have functioning symlinks.
Also if ``<COMMAND>test -h $<ENVAR>SENDMAILPATH</></>'' does fault in mysterious ways,
the reason may be that your system does not have symlinks.
</PARA>

<PARA>
If you are currently running Sendmail, kill your SMTP server
and drain the Sendmail queue.  There is no automatic method
to requeue Sendmail messages under ZMailer.  If you later want
to back out to Sendmail, all you need to do is move the former
version of the sendmail (on <FILENAME>/usr/lib/sendmail.bak</>,
for example) binary back to <FILENAME>/usr/lib/sendmail</>.
</PARA>

<PARA>
(You may also need to do some magics with system startup scripts
in case you are running SysV-style init. BSD <FILENAME>/etc/rc.local</>
does need its own gymnastics too.
Sample SysV-init script is at file: ``<FILENAME>proto/zmailer.init.sh</>'')
</PARA>

<PARA>
A sort of method to quickly handle your sendmail queue is to
start ZMailer's SMTP server, reconfigure the old sendmail to
use smarthost, which happens to be at the same machine.
(Or at an adjacent machine if you moved the queue, or ...)
Anyway the point is to get the sendmail to send its queue
via SMTP to the ZMailer.
An equally valid option is to drain the sendmail's queue by running
sendmail in queue drain mode only, although <FILENAME>/usr/lib/sendmail</>
points to ZMailer's ``<COMMAND>sendmail</>.''
</PARA>

</SECT2>

<SECT2><TITLE>Installation</>
<!-- \index{build!installation}\index{installation!entire ZMailer} -->

<PARA>
Once you are safe, run either:
<SCREEN>
  <PROMPT># </><USERINPUT>make install</>
</SCREEN>
(this installs all binaries and the default database files, which
still need editing! See below.)
or if you just want to have the new <EMPHASIS>binaries</> without touching
at your configurations:
<SCREEN>
  <PROMPT># </><USERINPUT>make install-bin</>
</SCREEN>
however this method might not be a complete success in case boilerplate
configurations need to be updated as well to match the programs.
</PARA>

<PARA>
There exists also a way to do the installation into a ``parallel universe''
by means of install-time ``prefix'' environment variable:
<SCREEN>
  <PROMPT># </><USERINPUT>prefix=/var/tmp/build make install-bin</>
</SCREEN>
which of course expects to have ``<FILENAME>/var/tmp/build/</>'' directory in existence,
and possibly some others under it, but you will soon see, what it needs.
</PARA>


<IMPORTANT>
<PARA>FIXME! FIXME! (Update with POST-INSTALL.SH program!)</PARA>
<PARA>
All programs are stored into
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/</>, and
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/ta/</>, and
possible older binaries are saved into ``<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">bak/</>''
subdirectories.
This step should be non-destructive (anything replaced will be
saved in a ``<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">bak/</>'' directory,
and <EMPHASIS>for some customizable files, if they exist, new versions
won't replace them</EMPHASIS>).
</PARA>

<PARA>
If this is not a from-scratch installation, be aware that the install
procedure will <EMPHASIS>not</> replace some of the files in
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILSHARE</>/</> with the equivalents
from the distribution.
Specifically, the <FILENAME>$<ENVAR>MAILSHARE</>/cf/*</>,
<FILENAME>$<ENVAR>MAILVAR</>/db/aliases</>,
<FILENAME>$<ENVAR>MAILVAR</>/db/routes</>, and
<FILENAME>$<ENVAR>MAILVAR</>/db/localnames</>
files are never replaced if they already exist.
The <FILENAME>$<ENVAR>MAILSHARE</>/forms/*</> files are always replaced,
but the old files will be saved in a ``<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">bak/</>''
directory.

<PARA>
Add the hostnames you want ZMailer to do local delivery for, to the

I usually add partially qualified domain names and nicknames in
addition to canonicalized names.  If you want to do local delivery
for mail clients, put their names in here too.  You may use pathalias 
style {\tt.domain} names in this file, to indicate everything under some
subdomain.
</PARA>

<PARA>
With the sample config files for Zmailer-2.98, and latter,
this {\tt localnames} is actually a mapping of those various names to
the desired forms of the canonic name, thus an example as seen

<PARA>
The {\tt fqdnaliases} database is for mapping fully-qualified user
addresses to others -- for example you machine has a set of
domain-names for it to consider local, but you want to have
separate people to be postmasters for each of them:
<SCREEN>

</PARA>

<PARA>
This facility is always in stand-by -- just add the file, and
you have it.
</PARA>

<PARA>
You may even handle just a few users for each of those domains, and then
have the ``{\tt routes}'' entry (see above) to declare something suitable:
<SCREEN>
  .domain1  error!nosuchuser
</SCREEN>
which combined with the ``{\tt fqdnalias}'' method will let
``{\tt postmaster@domain1}'' to exist, and report error on all others.

The normal {\em ZMailer} {\tt mailbox}(8) channel program.

\item[{\tt command="sm -8c \$channel procm"}] \mbox{}

<PARA>
For some uses the scheduler runs {\tt sm}(8) program -- called
``sendmail-like mailer''.
</PARA>

This supports {\em most} of {\em sendmail}'s {\tt M}-entry flags,
at least flags with versions previous to 8.x
</PARA>

<PARA>
The {\em ZMailer} {\tt sm}(8) channel program is used to create support
for things like:

In {\em smtpserver} front you may need to lower the strict standards

<SECT1><TITLE>Trimdown of Logging</TITLE>

<PARA>
Once satisfied that things appear to work, you may want to trim down
logging: there are four kinds of logging to deal with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Router logs:

Usually kept in {\tt \$LOGDIR/router}.  This is the stdout
and stderr output of the router daemon.  If you wish to turn it off,
see {\tt\$MAILSHARE/cf/standard.cf} for routine  {\tt dribble()},
and especially its invocations!

\item Scheduler logs:

Usually kept in {\tt \$LOGDIR/scheduler}.  Same as router.

\vspace{1pt}
\item General Mail Logs:

Usually kept in syslog files, depending on how you have configured
the syslog utility ({\tt /etc/syslog.conf}).
All ZMailer programs log using the LOG\_MAIL facility code for normal
messages.  You can deal with this specifically in your {\tt syslog}
configuration file on systems with a 4.3bsd-based syslog.  The
following reflects the recommended configuration on SunOS 4.0:
<SCREEN>
mail.crit   /var/log/syslog
mail.debug  /var/log/mail/mail.syslog
</SCREEN>

For pre-4.3bsd-based syslogs, you may want the syslog log file
to be just for important messages (e.g. LOG\_NOTICE and higher
priority), and have a separate file for informational messages
(LOG\_DEBUG and up).

\item By default, the postmaster will {\bf not} receive a copy
of all bounced mail; this can be turned on selectively by simply
editing the various canned forms used to create the error messages.
These forms are located in the FORMSDIR ({\tt proto/forms} in
the distribution, or {\tt \$MAILSHARE/forms} when installed).
You should review these in any case to make sure the text is
appropriate for your site.

\end{itemize}

<CHAPTER><TITLE>Installation to Clients</>

<PARA>
This section describes the installation at clients.
</PARA>

<SECT1><TITLE>Required Files</TITLE>

<PARA>
The following files/programs are needed on clients:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt /etc/zmailer.conf}

The {\tt \$MAILSERVER} variable may be set to the mail server host's name.
This is not required as {\tt mailq} will usually be able to discover this
by itself.

\vspace{1pt}
\item {\tt /usr/lib/sendmail}

to submit mail

\vspace{1pt}
\item {\tt mailq}

should be installed in the site's local {\tt bin} so people
can query the mail server. (Remember to update {\tt /etc/services})

\vspace{1pt}
\item {\tt \$POSTOFFICE}

This directory from the server should be mounted and writable.
\end{itemize}
</PARA>

</SECT1>

<SECT1><TITLE>Mounting <FILENAME>$MAILBOX</>es and/or
<FILENAME>$POSTOFFICE/</> Hierarchies via NFS</>

<PARA>
This is mostly for client machines,
but the NFS may plaque you also at servers.
</PARA>

<PARA>
If you for some obscure reason are mounting {\tt \$MAILBOX}es
and/or {\tt \$POSTOFFICE} hierarchies via NFS, do it with
options to disable various attribute caches:
<SCREEN>
              actimeo=0
    alias:    noac
</SCREEN>
</PARA>

<PARA>
<EMPHASIS>The best advice is to NOT to mount anything over NFS</>,
but some people can't be persuaded...
</PARA>

<PARA>
Lots of things are done where file attributes play important
role, and they are extremely important to be in sync!
(Sure, the `noac' slows down the system, but avoids errors
caused by bad attribute caches.)
</PARA>

<PARA>
If you are mounting people's home directories ({\tt .forward} et al.)
via NFS, consider the same rule!
</PARA>

<PARA>

</SECT1>

<SECT1><TITLE>Options for various facilities</TITLE>

<PARA>
\begin{description}
\item[\tt --prefix=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

The only really mandatory option, gives actually
defaults for \verb:MAILSHARE/MAILVAR/MAILBIN:.

\item[\tt --with-gcc] \mbox{}

Compile with GCC even when you have "cc" around.

\item[\tt --with-zconfig=/FILE/PATH] \mbox{}

Where the runtime   {\tt zmailer.conf}   file is located
at (and with what name).  This is {\bf the only} hard-coded
info within libraries and thus programs using them.
Everything else is runtime relocatable by means of using
"variables" listed in this file.

Default: {\tt /etc/zmailer.conf}

\item[\tt --with-mailbox=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

Overrides system-dependent location of the user mail-boxes.
Defaults are looked up thru list of directories:
\begin{alltt}
 /var/mail
 /var/spool/mail
 /usr/mail
 /usr/spool/mail
\end{alltt}
First found directory will be the default -- or then
system yields  {\tt /usr/spool/mail}

\item[\tt --with-postoffice=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

Overrides system-dependent location of the "{\tt \$POSTOFFICE}"
directory under which system stores queued email.
Will try directories \verb:/{usr,var}/spool/postoffice/: to
see, if previously installed directory tree exists.
Default will be  \verb:/var/spool/postoffice/:
in case there is no previously created postoffice directory.

\item[\tt --with-mailshare=/DIR/PATH]
\item[\tt --with-mailvar=/DIR/PATH]
\item[\tt --with-mailbin=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

These are overrides for values derived from  \verb:--prefix=/DIR:
option.  {\tt MAILSHARE = "\$PREFIX"}, {\tt MAILVAR = "\$PREFIX"},
but the last is {\tt MAILBIN = "\$PREFIX/bin"}

\item[\tt --with-logdir=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

Explicite value to replace {\tt \$LOGDIR} ZENV value and/or to
override default value of:  {\tt /var/log/mail}

\item[\tt --with-nntpserver=HOST] \mbox{}

If you want to use `{tt usenet}' channel, you need to name
NNTP server into which you feed news with NNTP.

\item[\tt --with-sendmailpath=/FILE/PATH] \mbox{}

Overrider for default location(s) of sendmail program.
ZENV variable {\tt\$SENDMAILPATH} can be overridden with this.

\item[\tt --with-rmailpath=/FILE/PATH] \mbox{}

Overrider for default location(s) of rmail program.
ZENV variable {\tt\$RMAILPATH} can be overridden with this.

\item[\tt --with-selfaddresses="NAME,NAME"] \mbox{}

Obsolete option regarding providing into in ZENV variable
to yield system internal names automagically for the SMTP
transport channel uses, and also for the router to see,
if destination IP address is local at the system.

\item[\tt --with-system-malloc] \mbox{}

Use system malloc() library, don't compile own:
Alternate for using: \verb:--with-libmalloc=system:
This is default.

\item[\tt --with-libmalloc=LIBNAME] \mbox{}

Where "{\tt LIBNAME}" is one of:
\begin{description}
\item[\tt system] \mbox{} 

System malloc() as is.

\item[\tt malloc] \mbox{}

Bundled "libmalloc" without debugging things.

\item[\tt malloc\_d] \mbox{}

Bundled "libmalloc" {\bf with} debugging things.
\end{description}

\item[\tt --with-yp] \mbox{}

Want to use YP, and has it at default locations

\item[\tt --with-yp-lib='-L... -lyp'] \mbox{}

If needed to define linking-time options to find the YP-library.

\item[\tt --with-ldap-prefix=DIRPREFIX] \mbox{}

If UMich/NetScape {\em LDAP} are available thru {\tt DIRPREFIX/include/}
and {\tt DIRPREFIX/lib/} locations, this is a short-hand to find
the interface -- with files in the system primary include
and lib locations,  "{\tt /usr}" is a special value which will be
ignored.  No default value for {\tt DIRPREFIX}.

\item[\tt --with-ldap-include-dir=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

Special overrider for compilation include directory of LDAP

\item[\tt --with-ldap-library-dir=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

Special overrider for linkage library directory of LDAP

\item[\tt --without-fsync] \mbox{}

At systems where the local filesystem is log-based/journaling,
doing   fsync()  is wastefull.  This disables fsync() in
cases where it is not needed.    (In others it may boost
your system performance by about 20\% -- with dangers..
On the other hand, recently a system disk(?) fault which
hang mailer at spool directory access did cause severe
damage all over, and propably use of this option would
not have made any difference..  fsck was mighty unhappy..)

\item[\tt --with-bundled-libresolv] \mbox{}

If your system is not very modern, you may consider using
this option to compile in a resolver from bind-4.9.4-REL.
On the other hand, if your system is modern, it may have
even newer resolver in it.  At such time, don't use this!

\item[\tt --with-ipv6] \mbox{}

Use IPv6 at things where it is supported.  This is often
highly experimental, although many subsystems in ZMailer
are built with   getnameinfo()  et.al. interfaces, which
works both on IPv4 and IPv6.

\item[\tt --with-ipv6-replacement-libc] \mbox{}

If the system needs more support for user-space IPv6
things, this generates those.

\item[\tt --without-rfc822-tabs] \mbox{}

Some systems dislike getting RFC-822 headers with form of:
\begin{alltt}
   "Headername: &lt;HTAB&gt; value"
\end{alltt}
With this option, no HTABs are used and instead "ordinary"
space character is used.

\item[\tt --with-tcp-wrappers]
\item[\tt --with-tcp-wrappers=/DIR/PATH] \mbox{}

Optional  {\tt =/DIR/PATH}  value gives directory where there are
{\tt tcpd.h}  and  {\tt libwrap.a}  files.
Without value this option looks for several common locations
for those files, and if finds them, yields compile and linking
hooks,

\item[\tt --with-ta-mmap] \mbox{}

On some systems with good {\tt mmap()} with ``MAP\_FILE\verb/|/MAP\_SHARED,''
and well behaving  {\tt munmap()}  it does make sense to replace
read()/write() thru a file-descriptor to the file with
mmap() -- however that requires munmap() {\bf not to} scrub
away in-mapped blocks any more actively, than the buffer-cache
works at read()/write() blocks.

This was default for a while, however most systems don't
have really well-behaved munmap()s :-/
(Perhaps IBM AIX is the only exception ?)

\item[\tt --with-getpwnam-library="-L... -l..."] \mbox{} \\

Certain sites have expressed wishes to use their own libraries
to replace the standard {\tt getpwnam()} (and possibly {\tt getpwuid()}
routines.
These are used in router, scheduler, mailbox, hold, and vacation
programs.

These programs use {\tt getpwnam()} libary call to look up
various customer usernames to whatever the system needs them
for.

\item[\tt --with-generic-include="-I/..."] \mbox{}

This parameter allows ubiquitous ``{\em -I/...}'' options to be used
in all program compilations throughout the package.

\item[\tt --with-whoson]
\item[\tt --with-whoson="/dir/prefix"] \mbox{} \\

This does explicite integration with {\em whoson} server; see
the ``whoson-*.tar.gz'' file in the ``contrib/'' subdirectory.

For {\em ZMailer} needs the library must support userids:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt root}
\item {\tt daemon}, or {\tt daemons}
\item {\tt nobody}
\end{itemize}
and whatever others your local system magic needs.
