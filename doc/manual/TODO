- convert baseline LaTeX to DOCBOOK SGML
- Write explanation about syslog format
- Tell 'mailq' behaviour, "mailq(1)" does not describe all parts
  of the reports
- Sync these texts with various man-pages now in existence,
  perhaps generate man-pages from common SGML source ?
- Auto-generated index sucks at PDF/DVI forms, HTML works ok :-/
