<TITLE><COMMAND>smtpserver</> Configuration</TITLE>

<PARA>
The <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</> is ZMailer's component to receive incoming
email via SMTP protocol.  Be it thru TCP channel, or thru Batch-SMTP.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</> program actually has several operational modes.
It can operate as a stand-alone internet service socket listener, which
forks off childs that do the actual SMTP-protocol service.
</PARA>

<PARA>
It can be started from under the control of the <COMMAND>inetd</>(8) server,
and it can there fulfill most of the the same roles as it does in
the stand-alone mode.
</PARA>

<PARA>
It can even be used to accept Batch-SMTP from incoming files (UUCP,
and BITNET uses, for example).
</PARA>

<PARA>
The runtime command-line options are as follows:
</PARA>

<CMDSYNOPSIS>

</PARA>

<PARA>
The most commonly used command line options are:
<SYNOPSIS>
 smtpserver [-aBivn] [-s ehlo-styles] [-l logfile] [-C cfgpath]
</SYNOPSIS>
</PARA>

<PARA>
Without any arguments the  <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</>  will start as a daemon
listening on TCP port 25 (SMTP).
</PARA>

<PARA>
The options are:
<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-a</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Query IDENT information about the incoming connection.
This information (if available at all) may, or may not tell who is forming
a connection.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-B</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
The session is Batch-SMTP a.k.a. BSMTP type of session. Use of "-i" option is needed, when feeding the input batch file.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-i</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
This is interactive session.  I/O is done thru stdin/stdout.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-v</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Verbose trace written to stdout for use in conjunktion with "-i", and "-B".
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-n</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
This tells that the <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</> is running under
<COMMAND>inetd</>(8), and that the stdin/stdout file handles
are actually network sockets on which we can do peer identity
lookups, for example.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-s ehlo-style</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Default value for various checks done at SMTP protocol MAIL FROM, RCPT TO,
VRFY, and EXPN commands. These are overridden with the value from
EHLO-patterns, if they are available (more below)
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-s 'strict'</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Special value directing the system to be extremely picky about the incoming
SMTP protocol &mdash; mainly for protocol compliance testing, usually way too
picky for average (sloppy) applications out there...
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-l logfilepath</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Filename for the <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</> input protocol log.
This logs about everything, except actual message data...
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-l 'SYSLOG'</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
This tells <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</> that it shall send all incoming smtp
protocol transactions via <EMPHASIS>syslog</> facility to elsewere.
Used syslog parameters are: FACILITY=mail, LEVEL=debug.
</PARA><PARA>
This option may be used in addition to the preceding file logging variant.
Double-use of file referring variant uses the last defined file, but this
doesn't affect files at all.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-C configfilepath</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Full path for the <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</> configuration in case
the default location can not be used for some reason.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>-M SMTPmaxsize</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
<EMPHASIS>SMTPmaxsize</> defines the absolute maximum size we accept
for incoming email. (Default: infinite) (This is a local policy issue.)
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>
</VARIABLELIST>
</PARA>

<SECT1><TITLE><FILENAME>smtpserver.conf</></>

<PARA>
If the system has file <FILENAME>$<VARNAME>MAILSHARE</>/smtpserver.conf</>
(by default), that file is read for various parameters, which can override
most of those possibly issued at the command line.
</PARA>

Example configuration is is in figure <XREF LINKEND="fig.sample-smtpserver-cfg">.

<PARA>
The PARAM keywords and values are:
<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>maxsize nn</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Maximum size in the number of bytes of the entire spool message
containing both the transport envelope, and the actual message.
That is, if the max-size is too low, and there are a lot of
addresses, the message may entirely become undeliverable..
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>max-error-recipients nn</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
In case the message envelope is an error envelope (MAIL FROM:&lt;&gt;),
the don't accept more than this many separate recipient addresses
for it. The default value is 3, which should be enough for most cases.
(Some SPAMs claim to be error messages, and then provide a huge
number of recipient addresses...)
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>MaxSameIpSource nn</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
(Effective only on daemon-mode server &mdash; not on "-i", nor "-n" modes.)
Sometimes some systems set up multiple parallel connections to same
host  (qmail ones especially, not that ZMailer has entirely clean
papers on this - at least up to 2.99.X series), we won't accept
more than this many connections from the same IP source address
open in parallel.  The default value for this limit is 10.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>ListenQueueSize nn</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
This relates to newer systems where the <COMMAND>listen</>(2)
system call can define higher limits, than the traditional/original 5.
This limit tells how many nascent TCP streams we can have in
SYN_RCVD state before we stop answering to incoming SYN packets
requesting opening of a connection.
</PARA><PARA>
There are entirely deliberate denial-of-service attacks based on
flooding to some server many SYNS on which it can't send replies
back (because the target machines don't have network connectivity,
for example), and thus filling the back-queue of nascent sockets.
This can also happen accidentally, as the connectivity in between
the client host, and the server host may have a black hole into
which the SYN-ACK packets disappear, and the client thus will not
be able to get the TCP startup three-way handshake completed.
</PARA><PARA>
Most modern systems can have this value upped to thousands to
improve systems resiliency against malicious attacks, and most
likely to provide complete immunity against the accidental
"attack" by the failing network routing.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>help 'string'</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
This one adds yet another string (no quotes are used) into those
that are presented to the client when it asks for "HELP" in the
SMTP session.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY>
<TERM>PolicyDB dbtype dbpath</TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
This defines the database type, and file path prefix to the binary
database containing policy processing information.  More of this
below.  Actual binary database file names are formed by appending
type specific suffixes to the path prefix.  For example NDBM
database appends ".pag" and ".dir", while BSD-Btree appends only
".db".  (And the latter has only one file, while the first has two.)

<PARA>
All lines that are not comments, nor start with uppercase keyword
``POLICY'' are ``EHLO-style patterns''.
This is the oldest form of configuring the <EMPHASIS>smtpserver</>, and
as such, it can be seen...
</PARA>

<PARA>
Behaviour is based on glob patterns matching the
<EMPHASIS ROLE="BOLD">HELO/EHLO</> name given by a remote client.
Lines beginning with a ``#'', or whitespace are ignored in the file,
and all other lines must consist of two tokens: a shell-style (glob) 
pattern starting at the beginning of the line, whitespace, and a 
sequence of style flags. The first matching line is used. As a 
special case, the flags section may start with a ! character in 
which case the remainder of the line is a failure comment message 
to print at the client. This configuration capability is intended 
as a way to control misbehaving client software or mailers.

Use  {\em\verb/[/ip.number\verb/]//maskwidth}  here for
listing those senders (networks) we absolutely trust.
You may also use domains, or domain suffixes so that the IP-reversed

fakeing the reversed domain names):
