	Have you looked at what the system tells when you do ETRN with
	any parameter ?

etrn foobar
250-2.0.0 A TURNME request is initiated - lets hope the system
250-2.0.0 has resources to honour it.   We call the remote, if
250 2.0.0 we have anything to send there.

	That is, if the desired destination address could be
	delivered via normal SMTP, then the ETRN queue start
	will also succeed in delivering to the remote.


	Using ETRN will, naturally, demand use of fixed addresses
	for the destination hosts, however you can't safely use
	host A records in the DNS, unless you have globally routable
	addresses in use.

	Consider using "private network 10":  My local network
	uses network 10 for a few things, and if your DNS entry
	for  client.com  is:

	client.com.  IN MX 1 mail.client.com.
		     IN MX 2 etrn.isp.com.
	mail.client.com IN A 10.10.10.10

	Ok, guess what will happen when my local system tries to
	deliver to "client.com" ?  It will at first try to connect
	to  mail.client.com, which -- shock and horror -- does exist
	in my private scoped network, but is different from the
	one really meant...

	(An ugly way to do this is to use same A record for domains
	 mail.client.com, and etrn.isp.com, and then within the host
	 etrn.isp.com to have /etc/hosts listing real address for
	 the mail.client.com -- but very rapidly that runs out of
	 manageability...)

	Still the host hosting that zone is out :-(
	Propably I have to place it into my workstation as soon
	as I can get the original zone datas...
