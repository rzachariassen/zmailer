<TITLE>Messaging</TITLE>

<PARA>
This chapter is quite different from the rest of this document.
Here we build a foundation for understanding messaging, instead
of focusing on how ZMailer behaves.
</PARA>
<PARA>
This chapter may feel a bit theoretical and abstract, being detached
from practical life.
</PARA>

<PARA>
In reality, however, experience shows that most problems with messaging
are a result of not understanding the underlying messaging model, or of
not respecting said model. </PARA>

<PARA>
The terminology used here may seem a bit X.400 oriented.
It is, because folks from what was then known as CCITT (now known as ITU-T)
adapted the model originally developed by IFIP.
Of course, CCITT added a lot of things of its own invention (like
ADMDs and PRMDs), that we don't need to bother ourselves with.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Although the terminology comes from X.400, it is in no way restricted to it.
Our presentation here is a generic messaging presentation not restricted
to any type of protocol.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Messaging, as the name says, is all about exchanging messages,
short (or sometimes long) pieces of information.
Messaging is always directional (which means that there is always
a sender and one or more recipients), targeted (the list of recipients
is fixed) and store-and-forward based.
</PARA>

<PARA>
There are a few messaging-like applications in which the message is
broadcast to a wide, unspecified audience.
A prime example of this latter application is Usenet News.
News is not messaging, as it is not targeted.
</PARA>

<PARA>
So what about mailing lists that are linked to News, are they messaging or not?
As long as the message is transported as a mail message, it is messaging.
One of the recipients of the message may well be a Usenet News newsgroup.
Similarly, a sender of a message might be the News system, or the author
who initiated the submission by using News. Messaging is not necessarily
interpersonal.
</PARA>

<PARA>
It is also quite normal for different applications to communicate by using
messaging methods.
A prime example of this would be EDI traffic. It is clearly messaging,
but not interpersonal.
</PARA>


<SECT2 ID=ztut-messaging-model>
<TITLE>The Messaging Model</TITLE>

<PARA>
In addition to users, the basic building blocks of messaging are
<EMPHASIS>User Agents (<ACRONYM>UA</>s)</> and
<EMPHASIS>Message Submission Agent (<ACRONYM>MSA</>)</> is newer term
for specific sub-task of Internet email, namely authenticated message
submission to first MTA of MTS system.
<EMPHASIS>Message Transfer Agents (<ACRONYM>MTA</>s)</>.
User agents are the interface through which a human user interacts with
the messaging system.
On non-interpersonal messaging user agents may be built directly into
applications.
MTAs are used to transport messages from one computer system to another.
An example of a good MTA is ZMailer. 
<EMPHASIS>Access Units (<ACRONYM>AU</>s)</>
can be used for accessing telematic services, for example telefax.
(Or in general act on user behalf somehow, e.g. automated scripts.)
<EMPHASIS>Message Stores (<ACRONYM>MS</>s)</>
can be used between MTAs and UAs.
They are used for storing messages before and while UAs are used
to access and manipulate them.
<EMPHASIS>Message Delivery Agent (<ACRONYM>MDA</>)</> is newer term
intended to cover specific sub-task of moving the message from MTA system
to the care of MS, UA or AU.  Some new MTA suites even do parts of the
UA functionality (<QUOTE><FILENAME>.forward</FILENAME></> -processing)
in the MDA.
<EMPHASIS>Gateways (<ACRONYM>GW</>s)</>
are used in between two different types of messaging systems,
for example between SMTP and X.400 mail.
Gateways are conceptually made of two MTAs and a UA that interconnects
them.
</PARA>

<PARA>
There are two more acronyms worth looking at in the messaging model,
namely <EMPHASIS><ACRONYM>MTS</> (Message Transport System)</> and
<EMPHASIS><ACRONYM>MHS</> (Message Handling System)</>.
MTS is the collection of MTAs (and GWs and MSAs and MDAs), while MHS
includes MTS and UA functionality (UAs, MSs and AUs).
</PARA>

<PARA>
All in all, X.400 terms are not a complete match on how things are done
in Internet email, nor should they be considered as normative, merely
giving you a reasonable frame of reference that isn't very wrong.
</PARA>

<PARA>
A graphical example of the messaging model is shown in figure
<XREF LINKEND="fig.ztut.messagemodel">.
It shows the relationships between different elements of the model.
</PARA>

</FIGURE>

<PARA>
As can be seen, a user may use more than one UA, and a UA can be connected 
to more than one MTA.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Although it is important to understand the relationships between different 
entities in the messaging model, it is even more important to understand the 
nature of a message and the way UAs and MTAs deal with it.
</PARA>

<PARA>
A message consists of a body and headers. In case of messages with more 
than one body-part (for example some MIME messages) the different body 
parts are all part of the outermost body-part.
</PARA>

<PARA>
As can be seen, there is always just one outermost body that contains 
all other body-parts. In some cases, for example X.400 the protocol 
seems to violate this by leaving out the outermost body-part. However, 
even on those cases we must assume, at the abstract level, 
that the outermost body-part is there.
</PARA>

<PARA>
However, this is not all that there is to the structure of a message. 
When a message is in transit, being handled by MTAs it is put inside 
an envelope, just like a normal letter is inside an envelope while 
the postal service is carrying it. Just like the postal service is not 
permitted to look inside the envelope, neither are MTAs permitted 
to look inside. Whenever there is a need to look inside the envelope, 
it is always a UA function, and done on behalf, and on the authority of, a UA.
</PARA>

<PARA>
There are some violations of this. When using the SMTP protocol, the 
<LITERAL>Received:</LITERAL>
lines are put in the headers by MTAs.
This is bad engineering, but as the process of adding a new header
line is fairly straightforward, it doesn't cause too much pain.
In some cases MTAs, and especially the GWs modify the header even more,
and sometimes they even mess with the body.
This is a sure recipe for trouble.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Graphically, the way a message should be dealt with is shown 
in figure <XREF LINKEND=fig.ztut.msgrout>.

  </MEDIAOBJECT>
</FIGURE>

<PARA>
The user creates the message with the help of a UA. How the interaction 
is arranged is a local matter. Once the message has been prepared, 
it is passed to a nearby MTA together with necessary envelope 
information and put into an envelope. The MTA puts its stamp on 
the envelope to show that it has received the message. The first 
MTA passes the message to the second MTA. The second MTA puts its 
stamp to the message and passes it to the third MTA, and so on. 
The final MTA passes the message to a UA, and the envelope is removed.
</PARA>

<PARA>
There are at least three ways to pass the message from an MTA to a UA. 
The message may be pushed to a (running) UA, a UA may pull it from an MTA, 
or an MTA may pass the message to an MS from which a UA will receive it at 
a convenient time.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The normal UNIX way of delivering mail
(<FILENAME>/usr/spool/mail/user</FILENAME>)
can be seen as any of the above three mechanisms, but should normally
be seen as a UA pulling a message. The reason for this confusion is
with the de-facto SMTP standard MTA, Sendmail.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Although Sendmail is in many ways a very clever piece of software,
it is also the reason for many problems, as it has blurred the line
between MTA and UA. Sendmail is clearly an MTA, but it also performs
many of the UA level functions, like handling of
<QUOTE><FILENAME>.forward</FILENAME></>
files.  This behaviour has become the de-facto standard  way for UNIX
MTAs to behave, making it necessary for any MTA, including ZMailer,
to behave the same way.
</PARA>

</SECT2>

<SECT2 ID=ztut-routing-and-delivering>
<TITLE>Routing And Delivering Messages</TITLE>


<PARA>
As MTAs only deal with envelopes, all routing and delivery decisions have to be
based on information available on the envelope. It follows from this that 
the envelope and headers may contain conflicting information. This is normal, 
and is not a cause for worry.
</PARA>

<PARA>
MTAs may, and often do modify addresses present in the envelope. This might 
include changing addresses to a format more suitable for mail delivery and 
alias expansion.
</PARA>

<PARA>
It is important to make a distinction between aliasing and forwarding mail. 
Aliasing is an MTA function, in which an MTA effectively knows that to reach 
a seemingly local user, mail should be sent to a different address. 
To accomplish this, the MTA changes the recipient information on the envelope. 
Forwarding is a UA function. When forwarding, the mail message is received 
by the original, intended recipient, and re-sent to another address. Although 
forwarding is a UA function, it doesn't have to result in a change to body or 
headers, but on the envelope, both sender and recipient should be changed. 
Sendmail bluntly violates this, and makes most other MTAs violate it as well.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Most mailing lists today are just alias expansions, on which one recipient 
address on the envelope is replaced with multiple addresses. In many cases 
this is a reasonable approach. However, all major mailing lists should be 
set up as a UA function. This involves changing not only the recipient 
address but also the sender address in the envelope. In this way, 
undeliverable messages are sent to the owner of the list, who can deal 
with the problem, and not to the sender of the message, who can do nothing 
to remedy the situation.
(The ZMailer has some built-in facilities for this, see about
<emphasis>Mailing Lists&hellip;</> on section
<XREF LINKEND="mailing-list-maintenance">.)
</PARA>

<PARA>
Error messages must be sent to the envelope sender address,
as this is a MTA function.
<!--
If a header like <QUOTE><LITERAL>Errors-to:</></> is being used, it implies 
that envelope sender should be sent to the one in the 
<QUOTE><LITERAL>Errors-to:</></>
header.
-->
</PARA>

<PARA>
Replies to messages should be sent to header addresses, because replying is 
a UA function.

<TITLE>ZMailer's Features, and Facilities</TITLE>


<SECT1 ID=ztut-zfeatures-intro>
<TITLE>Introduction</TITLE>

<PARA>
ZMailer is a mailer subsystem for the UNIX operating systems.
It is in charge of handling all mail messages that are created
on a system, from their creation until final disposition locally
or by transfer to another system.
</PARA>

<PARA>
As such, the mailer subsystem (the Message Transfer Agent) must
interface to local mail reading and composing programs (User Agents),
to the various transport methods that can be used to reach other mailers,
and to a variety of databases describing the mailer's environment.
</PARA>

<PARA>
ZMailer provides this functionality in a package and with a philosophy
that has benefitted from experiences with earlier mailers.
</PARA>

<PARA>
ZMailer provides a capable, robust, efficient subsystem to do the job,
which will excel in demanding environments, but is technologically simple
enough to fit easily everywhere.  (In UNIX-like environments.)
</PARA>

<PARA>
However ZMailer is not smallest memory footprint MTA there is, nor
it tries to be.
What it has and does, are ways to limit resource expenditure, while
still providing high-performance services.
One can't very easily overwhelm a machine where ZMailer MTA runs
by just feeding it too much work in parallel. (Message Queues can
grow beyond any reason, but even there are safety limiters.)
Limits are available for example:
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Number of parallel incoming SMTP sessions overall</></>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Number of parallel incoming SMTP sessions from any given single IP address</></>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Number of messages per source IP address in timeframe</></>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Number of parallel internal processing programs</></>
<LISTITEM><PARA>Number of parallel SMTP sessions feeding messages outside</></>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
</PARA>

<PARA>
For ZMailer's incoming SMTP interaction there are ways to define,
that the usual anonymous user from given address space can send
only so many messages with only so many recipients per time interval.
Such limits help keeping Zombie botnet Windows machines from causing
too much trouble.
Technology aimed for keeping such service abusers under control is
ever evolving, and can probably never be 100% capable.
Also the abusers do learn rather quickly what is bad in their
behaviour, and they do modify their programs to get past any
filters thrown at them.
At the same time, legitimate users are hadly ever evolving
their behaviour, and are always behaving rather foolishly, or
rather their used UA softwares behaves more like hijacked Zombies,
or perhaps there is just a NAT box, and several users beyond it...
</PARA>

<PARA>
In the longer run, service providers will need bigger and bigger
servers (or clusters of smaller servers) to make their inbound
and outbound SMTP services.
They will also need ways to track user behaviour online, and
if necessary, modify reaction algorithms in timescales of few hours.
Further complication is, that the service providers need different
behaviour models according to "this is Consumer" vs. "this is Corporate"
customer.
Corporate clients usually have some MTA of their own, and thus
their legitimate network behaviour is a lot more like what spammers
do these days, and separating spammer hijacked system there is really
difficult.

ZMailer is a multi-process mailer, using three daemon processes to manipulate
messages.
Used technologies are as simple as possible, e.g. while networking stuff
is as advanced as possible (with fallbacks to simplest basic behaviour),
some of other modern things (like threads) are not used in favor of 
simpler approaches 
</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Message arrive in via <COMMAND>sendmail</> program "API" for internally
originated messages, or via <COMMAND>Smtpserver</> subsystem,  which is
system front-door for messages coming in from the external network.
The <COMMAND>Smtpserver</> is in reality a cluster of auxiliary programs
providing efficient low-overhead support for various analysis things needed
while messages are coming in.
Second one of these processes is a <COMMAND>Router</>, and makes all
decisions about what should happen to a message; routing and possibly
message header visible things rewriting.
The third daemon is a message queue manager, <COMMAND>Scheduler</>,
used to schedule the delivery of messages.
The Router uses a configuration file that closely follows
<EMPHASIS>Bourne shell script</> syntax and semantics, with minimal magic.
Message files are moved around in a series of directories, and
the <COMMAND>Scheduler</> and its <COMMAND>Transport Agents</>
run off of control files created by the <COMMAND>Router</>.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
The <COMMAND>Sendmail</> is very simple "plug-compatible" message submission
agent for system internal message submissions into the ZMailer MTA, and
does all its things without any sort of set-uid privilege escalation needs.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
The <COMMAND>Smtpserver</> has evolved into rather complicated animal,
as it aims to really efficiently support things that in the early days
required truly heavy-weight auxiliary program startups for every incoming
SMTP connection &ddash; startup of such auxiliaries has now been shared
over a large number of arriving connection and messages by means of having
them as <COMMAND>Smtpserver's</> permant auxiliary helpers:
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
First is a slightly less burdened <COMMAND>Router</> for determining
if source or destination address domains are possibly known in the system,
and primarily being able to reject messages at front door that are destined
to nonexistent addresses.
(This instance is separate from <EMPHASIS>main</> <COMMAND>Router</>,
and thus is somewhat duplicating main Router's task, but this doesn't
e.g. do list expansions and other such expensive things.)
</PARA></LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
There is also <COMMAND>Content-Filter</> that can be used up to how ever
complicated message content analysis <EMPHASIS>syncronously</> with incoming
message feed  (there is also a possible "input" subdirectory for offline
non-synchronous content analysis, however synchronous processing has
certain appeal in itself, not the least the ability to tell message sender
to go and stuff their SPAMs into...)
</PARA></LISTITEM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
And third is the <COMMAND>Rate-Tracker</> subsystem, that can keep track
of such things as "Non-authenticated customer at IP address N.N.N.N has
sent more than 60 messages in past hour, stop that sending until the
sliding window allows more to be sent."
</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
These auxiliary servers do operate so that when smtpserver-subsystem
shutdown has been ordered, and last client needing support goes away,
they drop away themselves.
</PARA></LISTITEM>


<LISTITEM><PARA>
The <EMPHASIS>main <COMMAND>Router</> subsystem</> will process messages
one at a time (per <COMMAND>Router</> instance), as it finds them in a
directory where <EMPHASIS>User Agents</> submit their outgoing messages.
<EMPHASIS>Message Envelope</> and <EMPHASIS>Message Header</> information
is all kept in the same <EMPHASIS>message file</> along with
the <EMPHASIS>message body</>, and this file is never modified by
any ZMailer program.
After parsing the envelope and RFC822 header information,
the <COMMAND>Router</> validates the information extracted,
and calls functions defined in the configuration file to decide exactly,
how to deliver the message and how to transform the embedded addresses.
The algorithms that do this are easily re-configurable, since the control
flow and address manipulation is specified by familiar(ish) shell script
statements.
When the <COMMAND>Router</> is finished on a message, it will produce
a <EMPHASIS>message control file</> for use by the delivery processing
stage of ZMailer, and move the original message file to another location.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
Once the main <COMMAND>Router</> subsystem has decided what to do with
each of the addresses in a message, the <COMMAND>Scheduler</> builds
a summary of this information by reading the control file created by
the <COMMAND>Router</>.
This knowledge is merged with a data structure it maintains that stores
which messages are supposed to be sent where, and how.
According to a pre-arranged agenda, the <COMMAND>Scheduler</> will execute
delivery programs to properly move the message envelope, header, and body,
to the immediate destination.
These delivery programs are called <EMPHASIS>Transport Agents</>, and
communicate with the <COMMAND>Scheduler</> using a simple protocol that
tells them which messages to process and returns status reports to
the <COMMAND>Scheduler</>.
The <COMMAND>Scheduler</> also manages status reports, taking appropriate
action on delivery errors and when all delivery instructions for a message
have been processed.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
There are several standard <EMPHASIS>Transport Agents</> included with
the ZMailer distribution.
The collection currently includes a local delivery program, an SMTP client
implementation, and a Transport Agent that can run Sendmail-M-line-compatible
delivery programs.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
A separate <COMMAND>mailq</> utility allows querying the <COMMAND>Scheduler</>
for the state of its queues.
For existing <APPLICATION>Sendmail</> installations, a replacement program
is included that simulates most of the <APPLICATION>Sendmail</> functionality
in the ZMailer environment.
This allows ZMailer to replace a <COMMAND>Sendmail</> installation without
requiring changes in standard <EMPHASIS>User Agents</>.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
Several other tools and utilities exist for other specific purposes.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
There are also facilities that allow <EMPHASIS>loosely coupled cluster</>
creation.
Each member machine of the cluster is separate entity, but they can keep
track of <EMPHASIS>rate-tracking data</> of all of their neighbours, as
well as activate on demand <EMPHASIS>ETRN queue flush</> in cluster wide
setup.
None of these is guaranteed in any strict way, which makes their
implementation technology considerably simpler, and also occasional
limits that they implement are not considered to be upheld rigorously
under every possible conditions. A tripple-sigma reliability on e.g. limit
enforcement is considered "a plenty good enough".
</PARA>

<PARA>
In loosely coupled clusters, <EMPHASIS>delivery to system internal
(UNIX-style) message store is not clusterized</>, unless the store
in question is some sort of e.g. LMTP connected external Message Store.
(Even UNIX-style mailbox files may work, if underneath there is some
sort of cluster-wide filesystem, which has working FCNTL locks.)
One such way was once to use front-line processing to map arrived
message to actual recipient and node into which it was expected to
go, and to proxy POP and IMAP services so that users didn't need
to know on which node their mailboxes did actually reside.

We look closer into these issues at latter parts of this document,
but now it is sufficient to tell, that the principal tool for active
monitoring of the system health is command:
<SCREEN>
<PROMPT>$ </><USERINPUT>mailq -ss</></SCREEN>
which does tell, if router, or scheduler are up and about, or not,
and also does tell about the sizes of the different sub-spools.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The general management interface for starting and stopping different
subsystems is command
<SCREEN>
<PROMPT># </><USERINPUT>zmailer</>
</SCREEN>
which the system installs into
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/</> directory, and which command
usually needs a symlink to itself from some more common location for
administrative convenience
( <FILENAME CLASS="SYMLINK">/usr/sbin/zmailer</> ->
<FILENAME>$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/zmailer</> )
so that the administrator does not need to add
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/</>  directory
into his or her <ENVAR>PATH</ENVAR>.
On overall, it is intention that not even admin user should need
to run directly the programs located at the
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<ENVAR>MAILBIN</>/</>
directory.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Basically the administration is as follows:
<ITEMIZEDLIST>

<PARA>
There is also a way to make sure the system will not let the ZMailer
to start at the system start-up, because you have some massive work
going on, and the system is not in condition to accept email for a while: 
<SCREEN>
<PROMPT># </><USERINPUT>zmailer freeze</>

<SCREEN>
<PROMPT>$ </><USERINPUT><FILENAME>/usr/lib/sendmail</></>
</SCREEN>
(a.k.a. <FILENAME>/usr/sbin/sendmail</>)
which is <QUOTE>simple</> message submission program that mimics sendmail
commands behaviour, but of course many details of sendmail are

<TITLE>Comparison With Other Popular MTA's</TITLE>

<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><APPLICATION>sendmail</APPLICATION></TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
In the right hands, can be quite a flexible tool to translate
between the different conventions of various networks.  Unfortunately this
is accomplished by programming in an unfamiliar production language
containing many magic features.  The learning time for doing this is very
long, the effort involved is that of learning a completely new language and
environment. Moreover, Sendmail has all major components built into a
single large program. Both of these design decisions have been acknowledged
as mistakes by the author of Sendmail.  Its major shortcoming in comparison
to the <APPLICATION>MMDF</APPLICATION> mailer is its primitive database
facility and lack of caching.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><APPLICATION>sendmail 8.x</APPLICATION></TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Since long time of no development, sendmail got a development boost
around mid 1990'es, which has made it somewhat better, but still the
principal queuing model is the same as always.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>


<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><APPLICATION>MMDF</APPLICATION></TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
<APPLICATION>MMDF</> is a comprehensive mail environment, including its
own mail composition program and of course a mailer.
There are too many parts to it as can be said, it is a system, not a
subsystem), and the address manipulation is only sufficient for a
relatively homogeneous environment. It does have reasonable database
facilities and caching, as opposed to Sendmail, and the concept of Channels.
However, knowledge about address semantics is distributed in several
programs instead of being centralized.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>


<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><APPLICATION>PMDF</APPLICATION></TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
<APPLICATION>PMDF</> was originally a smaller version of <APPLICATION>MMDF</>
with correspondingly
reduced features and flexibility, but it has had years of development
since late 1980'es, and its commercial version is amongst the high
performers of MTAs in late 1990'es.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>


<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><APPLICATION>Upas</APPLICATION></TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
<APPLICATION>Upas</> is a curious approach to the problem.
It lets the user do half the work of message routing, in a manner
similar to <APPLICATION>PMDF</> on VMS systems. It is
entirely concerned with the message envelope, and leaves all message header
munging to auxiliary programs if appropriate. In fairness one should note
this mailer was developed in an environment where most message headers were
scorned, thus making this a reasonable approach (<QUOTE>optimize the normal
case</>). The Eighth Edition Upas had no database capability at all, but it
did exhibit one useful characteristic: the routing decisions are made by
passing the recipient envelope address through a set of regular
expressions. This production rule approach is similar to what Sendmail
does, but uses a more familiar mechanism and environment.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>


<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><APPLICATION>Smail 3.0</APPLICATION></TERM>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
Another recently developed (late 1980'es), mailer worth mentioning here is
<APPLICATION>Smail3.0</>.
It is intended as a program capable of replacing Sendmail in many
situations. To a large extent it succeeds as this, and there are some nice
ideas involved as well. Its two major drawbacks are that it is not as easy
to adapt to local needs as Sendmail is (compiled instead of interpreted
rules and algorithms), and retaining Sendmail's single-program design.  It
addresses database and caching issues, and seems generally like a nicer
design in many respects, a bit like PMDF's configuration options in a
Sendmail package.

<PARA>
Until the recent increase in the demand for inter-network mail gatewaying,
Sendmail's flexibility had quite adequately served to implement a gateway
function between selected networks.  With increased variety of the normal
address syntax and mail capabilities of connected networks, and more complex
kinds of routing decisions becoming necessary, the existing mailers have
been showing their age and their limits.  ZMailer is intended to give the
mail administrator a software tool that fits the times.
