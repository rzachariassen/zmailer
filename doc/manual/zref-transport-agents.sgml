The <COMMAND>mailbox</> is a ZMailer transport agent which is usually
only run by the <COMMAND>scheduler</>(8) program to deliver mail to
local user mailbox files. The <COMMAND>mailbox</> program must be run
with root privileges and invoked with the same current directory as
the <COMMAND>scheduler</>, namely:
  <FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<VARNAME>POSTOFFICE</>/transport/</>.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Recipient addresses are processed  as follows: 
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
 Strip doublequotes around the address, if any. 
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
 Strip prefixing backslashes, if any.  
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
 If the address starts with a ``|'', the rest of the recipient address 
 string is interpreted as  a shell command to be run. 
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
 If the address starts with a ``/'', the recipient address is a 
 filename to append the message to. 
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
 Otherwise the recipient address must be a local user id. 
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
 If user is not found, and the first character of the address is a capital 
 letter, the entire address is folded to lowercase and the user lookup is
 retried.
</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
</PARA>


<PARA>
If delivering to a user mailbox (<FILENAME>$<VARNAME>MAILBOX</>/userid</>)
which does not exist, <COMMAND>mailbox</> will try to create it.
If the <FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<VARNAME>MAILBOX</>/</> directory is
mounted from a remote system this will succeed if the directory is group
writable.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Some sanity checks are done on deliveries to files and mailboxes:
<ITEMIZEDLIST>
<LISTITEM><PARA>
 The file being delivered to must have one link only, and must be either 
 ``<FILENAME>/dev/null</>'' or a regular file.
</PARA></LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>
 The file lock must be held.
 (See below for a chapter about locks.)  
</PARA></LISTITEM>
</ITEMIZEDLIST>
</PARA>

<PARA>
There is a further sanity check on mailbox deliveries, namely if
the mailbox is not empty the <COMMAND>mailbox</> program will
enforce 2 newlines as a separator before the message to be 
delivered.
This guarantees that User Agents, like <COMMAND>Mail(1)</>,
can find the about-to-be delivered message even  if the current
contents of the mailbox is corrupt.
</PARA>

<PARA>
When delivering to a process (by starting a Bourne shell to 
execute a specified command line), the environment is set up to 
contain <ENVAR>$PATH</>, <ENVAR>$SHELL</>, <ENVAR>$HOME</>, 
<ENVAR>$USER</>, <ENVAR>$SENDER</>, <ENVAR>$UID</> environment variables.
The <ENVAR>$HOME</> and <ENVAR>$USER</> values are the recipient user's
home directory and login id respectively.
The <ENVAR>$SENDER</> value is the sender address for the message
(as it would appear in a ``<COMPUTEROUTPUT>From </>''-line), and the UID
value is the owner id of the process.
The <LITERAL>SIGINT</> and <LITERAL>SIGHUP</> signals are ignored, but
<LITERAL>SIGTERM</> is treated normally.
If the process dumps core, it will be retried later.
Otherwise any non-zero exit status is taken as a permanent failure, and
will result in an error message back to the sender.
The actual data delivered to a file, mailbox, or process are identical.
It consists of the concationation of a UUCP style separator line,
the message header specified in the message control file, and the message
body from the original message file.
The separator line starts with ``<COMPUTEROUTPUT>From </>'' and is followed
by the sender address and a timestamp.
</PARA>

<PARA>
After all deliveries and just before exiting, the mailbox process
will poke <APPLICATION>comsat(8C)</> in case recipients have turned
on <APPLICATION>biff(1)</>.
The program may be compiled to look in the <APPLICATION>rwho</> files
on the system for recipient names logged onto neighbouring hosts, in which
case the <APPLICATION>comsat</> on the remote host will be poked.
Even if this compile-time option is enabled, this will only be done for
users that have a ``<FILENAME>.rbiff</>'' file in their home directory.
(Unless an ``<OPTION>-DRBIFF_ALWAYS</>'' compile option is used.)

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM>Interface:</TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>

As with all transport agents, the program reads relative
pathnames of message control files from  standard input 
(terminated with two linefeeds), and produces diagnostic
output on the standard output.
Normal diagnostic output is of the form:

<SCREEN>
id/offset&lt;TAB&gt;notify-data&lt;TAB&gt;status message
</SCREEN>

where id is the inode number of the message file, offset is a
byte offset within its control file where the address being
reported on is kept, status is one of ok, error, or deferred,
and the message is descriptive text associated with the report.
The text is terminated by a linefeed.
Any other format (as might be produced by subprocesses) is passed
to standard output for logging in the scheduler log.
The exit status is a code from <FILENAME>&lt;sysexits.h&gt;</>.

used for mailbox spool files, and separately for other regular files.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM>Security:</TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
Like all parts of ZMailer, the mailbox chooses to err on the overly
cautious side.

is started through <FILENAME>/bin/sh</> with severely sanitized environment
variables, and with only the file descriptors <LITERAL>STDIN</>,
<LITERAL>STDOUT</>, and <LITERAL>STDERR</>.
Programs are refused from running, if address analysis has found
suspicuous data; external messages cannot directly run programs,
nor those addresses that have had a security breach detected during
<FILENAME>~/.forward</>- or other aliasing analysis.
(Same applies also with writing into explicitely named files.)
</PARA>
<PARA>
The pipe subprogram is run with user-id it gets thru the address

Configuration:
</PARA>

<PARA>
The configuration file <FILENAME>$<VARNAME>MAILSHARE</>/sm.conf</>
associates the mailer keyword from the command line with a specification
of a delivery program.
This is very similar to the way the definition of a ``mailer'' in
<COMMAND>sendmail</>(8).
It requires flags, a program name, and a command line specification.
These are in fact the fields of the entries of the configuration file.
Lines starting with whitespace or a ``<EMPHASIS ROLE="STRONG">#</>''
are ignored, and all others are assumed to follow format shown in figure
<XREF LINKEND="fig.ref.sample-sm-conf">.
</PARA>

</SCREEN>
</FIGURE>

<PARA>
The mailer field extends from the beginning of the line to the first
whitespace.
It is used simply as a key index to the configuration file contents.
One or more whitespace is used as the field separator for all the fields.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The flags field contains a concatenation of one-letter flags.
If no flags are desired, a ``<EMPHASIS ROLE="STRONG">-</>''
character should be used to indicate presence of the field.
All normal <APPLICATION>sendmail</> (<EMPHASIS>of 5.x era..</>)
flags are recognized, but the ones that do not make sense in
the context of ZMailer will produce an error (or some are ignored).
The flags that change the behaviour of <COMMAND>sm</> are:

<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>b</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
will activate BSMTP-type wrapping with a ``hidden-dot''
algorithm; e.g. quite ordinary SMTP stream, but in ``batch mode''.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>B</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
The  first ``<OPTION>B</>''  turns on similar BSMTP wrapping
as ``<OPTION>b</>'', but adds
SIZE and, if the <COMMAND>sm</> is  started  with option ``<OPTION>-8</>'',
also 8BITMIME options.  The second ``<OPTION>B</>'' adds there also DSN
(Delivery Status  Notification) parameters.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>E</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
will prepend ``<OPTION>&gt;</>'' to any message body line starting
with ``<EMPHASIS ROLE="STRONG">From </>''. (Read: ``From-space'')
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>f</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
adds ``<OPTION>-f sender</>'' arguments to the delivery program.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>n</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
will not prepend a ``<EMPHASIS ROLE="STRONG">From </>''-line
(normal mailbox separator line) to the message.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>r</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
adds ``<OPTION>-r sender</>'' arguments to the delivery program.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>S</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
will run the delivery program with the same real and effective uid as
the <COMMAND>sm</> process.
If this flag is not set, the delivery program will be run with the real
uid of the <COMMAND>sm</> process.
This may be useful if <COMMAND>sm</> is setuid.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>m</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
informs <COMMAND>sm</> that each instance of the delivery program
can deliver to many destinations.
This affects <OPTION>$u</>  expansion  in the argument list, see below.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>P</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
prepends a ``Return-Path:'' header to the message.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>U</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
will prepend a ``<EMPHASIS ROLE="STRONG">From </>''-line, with
a ``remote from myuucpname'' at the end, to the message.
This is what is expected by remote  <COMMAND>rmail</>(1)
programs for incoming UUCP mail.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>R</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
use CRLF sequence as end-of-line sequence. Without
it, will use LF-only end-of-line sequence.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>X</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
does SMTP-like ``hidden-dot'' algorithm  of doubling
all dots that are at the start of the line.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>7</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
will strip (set to 0) the 8th bit of every character in the message.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>
</VARIABLELIST>
</PARA>

<PARA>
The path field specifies the location of the delivery program.
Relative pathnames are allowed and are relative to the
<FILENAME CLASS="DIRECTORY">$<VARNAME>MAILBIN</>/</> directory.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The arguments field extends to the end of the line.
It contains whitespace separated <OPTION>argv</> parameters which may
contain one of the following sequences:

<VARIABLELIST>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>$g</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
which is replaced by the sender address.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>$h</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
which is replaced by the destination host.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>

<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><OPTION>$u</OPTION></TERM><LISTITEM><PARA>
which is replaced by the recipient address.
If the ``<OPTION>m</>'' mailer flag is set and there are several
recipients for this message, the argument containing the ``<OPTION>$u</>''
will be replicated as necessary for each recipient.
