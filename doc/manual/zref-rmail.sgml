<PARA>
<EMPHASIS>rmail</> is a program to process incoming UUCP mail.
<EMPHASIS>rmail</> is usually invoked by a remote UUCP neighbour
host's mailer using a command line like:
</PARA>

<SYNOPSIS>
uux - -r -asender -gC thishost!rmail (recipient1) (recipient2) ...
</SYNOPSIS>

<PARA>
The end result is that the remote neighbour's <EMPHASIS>uuxqt</>(8)
runs <EMPHASIS>rmail</> on <EMPHASIS>thishost</> with this command line:
<SCREEN>
rmail recipient1 recipient2 ...
</SCREEN>
</PARA>

<PARA>
In both cases, a UUCP format mail message is on the standard input.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The task of <EMPHASIS>rmail</> is to transform the trace information in
the UUCP format message to the equivalent RFC822 trace information, and
to submit the message to the <COMMAND>zmailer</>(1) router with
the appropriate envelope information.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The expected input format looks like:
<SCREEN>
From address3  date3 remote from host3
&gt;From address2  date2 remote from host2
&gt;From address1  date1 remote from host1
</SCREEN>
followed by the rest of the message.
This is considered equivalent to the following
(as it might appear in a mailbox):
<SCREEN>
From host3!host2!host1!address1 date
Received: by host3 ... ; date3
Received: by host2 ... ; date2
Received: by host1 ... ; date1
</SCREEN>
</PARA>

<PARA>
In order for the mailer to process the incoming message properly,
<EMPHASIS>rmail</> must be run by a ``<EMPHASIS>userid</>'' which
the <COMMAND>router</>(1) will accept forged mail from.
his is normally the UUCP account id.

will use the argument as the  default remote UUCP host name
to use if there is no <EMPHASIS>remote from host</> tag in the
first <EMPHASIS>From-space</> line in the message.
The  default value for this is usually <EMPHASIS>somewhere</>
or <EMPHASIS>uunet</>
(since uunet was a frequent purveyor of this protocol violation).
