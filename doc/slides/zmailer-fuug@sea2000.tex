\begin{slide}
\centerline{\large A bit of History}

\vfill
\ZM{} was created at {\it University of Toronto} around 1986 by
Mr. {\it Rayan Zachariassen} (hence the ``Z'' in the name.)

Rayan went to private sector around 1992, and $ZMailer$ development
was essentially abandoned by him.

Since then, yours truly has been hacking at it developing all kinds
of extensions for modern Internet email.

\centerline{\large \ZM{} structure}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{3in}

 \epsfig{file=zmprocs.ps,width=2.7in}
}
\end{wrapfigure}

\ZM{} consists of several main subsystems running in coordinated,
although separate existence.  This means also that any of the subsystems
can be shut down for a while without harming other subsystem functionality.

The task-transfer in between the subsystems is done via
the filesystem -- {``\it spool''}.

\end{wrapfigure}

Input subsystems: {\it sendmail, smtpserver, rmail, mail(3)} library

Routing subsystem: {\it router}

Delivery subsystem: {\it scheduler,} and {\it transport agents}

\vfill

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{slide}

\centerline{\large \ZM{} subsystems: {\it ``POSTOFFICE/''}}

The \verb!$POSTOFFICE/! is \ZM{}'s way of referring to filesystem
where a few basic things are guaranteed to happen:
\begin{enumerate}
\item moving files around with {\it rename(2)} and/or {\it link(2), unlink(2)}
      works just fine in between different directories
\item i-node numbers are preserved over {\it rename(2)}, and {\it link(2)}
	system calls
\end{enumerate}

There are filesystems where these two things don't happen, e.g. possibly
{\it link(2)} can't be done in between directories.  Such ones are not
suitable for \ZM's \verb!$POSTOFFICE/! partition use.
\vfill

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{slide}

\centerline{\large \ZM{} subsystems: {\it ``sendmail''}}

For normal local system use there needs to be a well-known
submission interface for email.  A de-facto one is {\it sendmail.}

\ZM's {\it sendmail} implements most of message submission options
of the real {\it sendmail(8).}

Many of {\it sendmail(8)} options are meaningless in \ZM{}, and thus
they are ignored, or in case of several administrative functions,
start subsystems in interactive test mode and/or just plain complain
loudly.

For message submission, \ZM's {\it sendmail} is extremely
{\it lightweight} one.  Just writing the message envelope and
message to the file, and moving it to {\it router} subsystem's care.

\ZM's {\it smtpserver} subsystem implements a rich set of enhanced SMTP
features defined over the last 10 or so years.

At the same time it aims to be lightweight, fast protocol receiver with
ability to quickly verify incoming protocol stream syntax conformance,
but it can also be configured to behave sloppily in this regard.
