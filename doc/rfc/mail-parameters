MAIL SERVICE TYPES

The set of services desired from a mail server are sometines
characterises by the "hello" keword used.  These are listed here.

Keywords        Description                              Reference
------------    --------------------------------         ---------
HELO            Simple Mail                               [RFC821]
EHLO            Mail Service Extensions                  [RFC1869]
LHLO            Local Mail                               [RFC2033]


MAIL ENCRYPTION TYPES

[RFC822] specifies that Encryption Types for mail may be assigned.
There are currently no RFC 822 encryption types assigned.  Please use
instead the Mail Privacy procedures defined in [RFC1421, RFC1422,
RFC1423].


SMTP SERVICE EXTENSIONS

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC821] specifies a set of commands
or services for mail transfer.  A general procedure for extending the
set of services is defined in [STD11,RFC1869].  The set of service
extensions is listed here.

The service extensions are identified by keywords sent from the server
to the client in response to the EHLO command.

Keywords	Description				 Reference
------------    --------------------------------         ---------
SEND		Send as mail				  [RFC821]
SOML		Send as mail or terminal		  [RFC821]
SAML		Send as mail and terminal		  [RFC821]
EXPN		Expand the mailing list			  [RFC821]
HELP		Supply helpful information		  [RFC821]
TURN		Turn the operation around		  [RFC821]
8BITMIME	Use 8-bit data				 [RFC1652]
SIZE		Message size declaration		 [RFC1870]
VERB		Verbose		                     [Eric Allman]
ONEX		One message transaction only	     [Eric Allman]
CHUNKING        Chunking                                 [RFC1830]
BINARYMIME      Binary MIME                              [RFC1830]
CHECKPOINT	Checkpoint/Restart                       [RFC1845]
PIPELINING      Command Pipelining                       [RFC2197]
DSN             Delivery Status Notification             [RFC1891]
ETRN            Extenderd Turn                           [RFC1985]
ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES Enhanced Status Codes                [RFC2034]

Some of these keywords have parameters.  These are listed here (those
keywords not listed here have no parameters).

Service Ext      EHLO Keyword   Parameters               Reference
-----------      ------------   -----------              ---------
Size		 SIZE            number                  [RFC1870]


MAIL CONTENT DISPOSITION

In RFC 2183 there is a discussion of the "Content-Disposition" header
field and the description of the initial parameters allowed in this
header.  Additional parameters may be registered with the IANA
following the procedues in section 9 of RFC 2183.

Name        Description                                        Reference
-----       ------------                                       ---------
inline      displayed automatically                            [RFC2183]
attachment  user controlled display                            [RFC2183]


MAIL SYSTEM NAMES and ADDRESS TYPES

In some places, an identification of other mail systems is used.

One of these is in "The COSINE and Internet X.500 Schema" (section
9.3.18) [RFC1274].  The mail system names listed here are used as the
legal values in that schema under the "otherMailbox" attribute
"mailboxType" type (which must be a PrintableString).

Another place is in "Mapping between X.400(1988) / ISO 10021 and RFC
822" (section 4.2.2) [RFC1327].  The names listed here are used as
the legal values in that schema under the "std-or-address" attribute
"registered-dd-type" type (which must be a "key-string").

Note that key-string = <a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-" >.

Mail System Name	Description			Reference

Notification [RFC1891].

Notification [RFC1891].

MAIL TRANSMISSION TYPES


The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC821] and the Standard for the
Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages [RFC822] specify that a set of
"Received" lines will be prepended to the headers of electronic mail
messages as they are transported through the Internet.  These received
line may optionally include either or both a "via" phrase and/or a
"with" phrase.  The legal values for the phrases are listed here.  The
via phrase is intended to indicate the link or physical medium over
which the message was transferred.  The with phrase is intended to
indicate the protocol or logical process that was used to transfer the
message.


VIA link types	Description				Reference
