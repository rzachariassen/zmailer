The original author of the <B>ZMailer</B> is <I>Rayan Zachariassen</I>
(hence the ``<B>Z</B>'' at the name) who was at <I>University of Toronto</I>
back in late 1980es, and didn't like the way the sendmail was able to cause
serious system loads when doing deliveries, nor the way how it appeared to
find a new security hole at the sendmail nearly every week... (That was back
n 1980es with sendmail-5.x.)
<P>
The current author, and keeper of <B>ZMailer</B> is <I>Matti Aarnio</I>,
who has been doing things of his interests to the <B>ZMailer</B> since 1990,
and has been sole keeper of mailer since 1992, when <I>Rayan</I> went to
private sector, and disappeared from academic community.
