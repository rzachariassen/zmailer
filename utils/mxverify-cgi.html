  --  The program does presume exactly the order and names of
  --  things within the  <FORM ... >  thing below.
  --
  --  Method must stay "GET", ACTION you can change to your
  --  local server, INPUT sequence must stay in that order;
  --  the first one must be the userinput with TYPE="TEXT",
  --  and NAME="DOMAIN".
  --
  --  As of current date, source of that program is in the CVS
  --  development branch only; not yet in any release.

<H1>Interactive DNS MX-verify CGI running at  nic.funet.fi</H1>
<P>
Enter here <I>the domain, or email address</I> for which you want to have
the backup delivery things verified.
<P>
The domain name (of address!) you give below <B>must</B> have MX records at it.
If there are no MXes for given domain, email <I>might</I> get delivered
by means of using traditional ``if there are no MXes, use A'' operational
rule in the internet.  However this utility won't (naturally) have
any usefull work in that case, and it reports an error (but continues..)
<P>
This does not <I>send</I> any email to you, just does a series of
connections, plus interactive reception address tests of following kind:
<P>
<PRE>
  MAIL FROM:&lt;&gt;
  RCPT TO:&lt;postmaster@that.domain&gt;
  RCPT TO:&lt;your.address@that.domain&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
The explanation:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The ``MAIL FROM:&lt;&gt;'' is RFC 821 defined error message transport,
which many systems fault -- they must not do so.
<LI> And every email receiving domain <B>must</B> have <B>postmaster</B>
account, so says RFC 822 standard.
<LI> And finally (if you have an address, and not just a domain), also
tries to use your given domain.
</UL>
<P>
For each server, it is acceptable to yield:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>``ERROR: Connection Timed Out'' -- server wasn't reachable within tester's short 20 second timeout period; this may be due to firewall blocking access to the primary servers with an intention that incoming email comes thru backup servers only. (More usual connection timeout is 5-10 minutes.)
<LI>``ERROR: Connection Refused'' -- either the destination server does not have SMTP server running, <B>or</B> network firewall near the destination server blocks access to it with an intention of quicker move to backup MX entries.
<LI>``Apparently OK'' -- the address tests gave an OK result.
</UL>
<P>
Anything else means you have to figure out, what is going on.
Especially if any backup server rejects the ``RCPT TO'' with 400- or 500-series
codes.
<P>
<H2>Domain or Email Address:</H2>
<FORM METHOD="get"   ACTION="http://www.funet.fi/cgi-bin/mxverify-cgi">
<INPUT TYPE="text"   VALUE="" NAME="DOMAIN" SIZE=80 MAXLENGTH=200>
<BR>
<INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="SUBMIT" VALUE="SUBMIT">
<INPUT TYPE="reset"  NAME="RESET"  VALUE="RESET">
</FORM>
<P>
<I>All tests this CGI does must yield ``Apparently OK'' if you aspire
to have any change at having reliably working incoming email.
(or ``Connection Timeout'' or ``Connection Refused'')
</I>
<P>
This CGI utility is one of <A HREF="http://www.zmailer.org/">ZMailer</A>
auxiliary utilities, and it was written by
<A HREF="mailto:mea@nic.funet.fi">Matti Aarnio</A>
after he got sufficiently annoyed about failing
backup-MX servers for lots of different domains gave reports of
type:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> ``not relaying to that domain''
<LI> ``you are not allowed to relay to that domain''
<LI> ``this is not our relaying customer''
<LI> ``sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed rcpthosts''
<LI> ``This target address is not our MX service client.''
</UL>
<P>
most common of which are rather misleading wordings about what is going on;
that the server administrator has not listed allowed relay destinations
into some file...
