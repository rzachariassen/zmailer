		MAILQ protocol version 2


Scheduler writes following to the interface socket:

	"version zmailer 2.0\n"
	"some magic random gunk used as challenge\n"

Then client writes there:

	"AUTH username HEXAUTHENTICATOR\n"

and scheduler replies:

	"- some message \n"
	"+ some message \n"

where "+" at line beginning is success (and anything else is failure).

That done, initial login phase has completed, and actual command interface
can commence.

The HEXAUTENTICATOR is calculated by catenating the challenge line
(without its ending '\n'), and user password, and doing MD5 over them.
Then the resulting message digest is printed out bytewise with "%02x",
that is, lowercase hex characters.
