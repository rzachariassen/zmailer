		MAILQ protocol version 2


Scheduler writes following to the interface socket:

	"version zmailer 2.0\n"
	"some magic random gunk used as challenge\n"

Then client writes there:

	"APOP username HEXAUTHENTICATOR\n"

and scheduler replies:

	"- some message \n"
	"+ some message \n"

where "+" at line beginning is success (and anything else is failure).

That done, initial login phase has completed, and actual command interface
can commence.
