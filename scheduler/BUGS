"BUGS", or rather: "Open Issues" on the ZMailer-3.0 scheduler:

- Should implement "idlemin=", which per default is 0, and
  when set would force a minimun wait before the process
  were taken from the idle pool to anything but the task
  it was doing last. (Keeping SMTP connection caches around..)
  (Actually... should have a process that keeps open N TCP
   streams to the world, and juggles SMTP transport on them all..
   ... and support for one processor process doing N tasks in
   parallel..)

- IETF NOTARY-WG error reports  (mostly done, but..)
