"BUGS", or rather: "Open Issues" on the ZMailer-3.0 scheduler:

- When activating idle processors, should attempt to use
  transporter with SAME target host as last time  (so the
  SMTP-transporter can keep a sort of connection cache...)

- Should implement "idlemin=", which per default is 0, and
  when set would force a minimun wait before the process
  were taken from the idle pool to anything but the task
  it was doing last. (Keeping SMTP connection caches around..)
  (Actually... should have a process that keeps open N TCP
   streams to the world, and juggles SMTP transport on them all..
   ... and support for one processor process doing N tasks in
   parallel..)

- IETF NOTARY-WG error reports  (mostly done, but..)

- Transport-agents should store error information into the job-
  files instead of scheduler doing it now, so that in permanent
  error cases the scheduler can be knocked down, and still have
  error reports even when using non-synchronous communication
  ( = overfeeding )

- Sometimes transport-agents and scheduler loose their sync :-(
  (5-Jan-96: "#resync fileid" responce.. Perhaps they now regain
	     the sync ?)
