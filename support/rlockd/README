A simple network locking daemon that uses flock. The client code to
communicate with the daemon is in the nfslock(3) routine.

We install it in /local/etc -- if you wish to change that, change
the Makefiles and the following instructions suitably.

You should add the following line to /etc/services so nfslock
can get the service port by name.

flock		3876/tcp			# NFS flock

If you have a BSD4.3/SunOS4.0/Ultrix system with an /etc/inetd.conf file,
then add the following line to that file on the machines that run in.rlockd:

flock	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/local/etc/in.rlockd	in.rlockd

If you have a BSD4.2/SunOS3.5 system, with an /etc/servers file, then
add the following line to that file on the machines that run in.rlockd

flock   tcp     /local/etc/in.rlockd
