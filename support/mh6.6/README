Patches to MH6.5:

This is necessary due to bugs in MH's SMTP client code.  It is just as bad
a problem with Sendmail, except Sendmail's SMTP server is correspondingly
buggy, cancelling out MH's bugs (!).  You probably want to install the
included smail.c file in any case.

- install the included smail.c in the mts/sendmail directory
- apply the patch to conf/mhconfig.c
- configure MH to use zmailer instead of (say) sendmail/smtp (see the MH file)
  This requires the sendmail compatibility program installed in /usr/lib.
  MH's post program will invoke it with the '-bs' options to speak SMTP to it.

From the MH toplevel directory, do:

	make clean
	( cd conf ; make mhconfig ; mhconfig MH )
	make
