nfslock does either a flock if the file is on a local disk, or contacts
in.rlockd for a remote lock across nfs -- nfslock is the library for the
client. in.rlockd is the daemon.

You should add the following line to /etc/services so nfslock
can get the service port by name.

flock		3876/tcp			# NFS flock


Run in.rlockd on machines from which you import network filesystems that you
wish to be able to lock files on.
