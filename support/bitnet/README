The programs here may be of help if you are trying to make your host a
native BITNET mail host.  The basic idea is to transform XMAILER NAMES
into something similar to hosts.transport (in the default configuration
I call it bitnet.transport), which has entries like:

.ccrit.doc.ca			bsmtp3!mailer!qucdn
anlpns				defrt1!anlpns
atgbox				defrt1truncate!atgbox
dk0rrzk2			bsmtp3!vmmail!dk0rrzk2
sfu				bitnet2!mailer!sfu
sfu.ca				bitnet2deliver2!mailer!sfu

If you don't know what these things mean, do some research before you
continue.

The default configuration knows about these channel names, and will invoke
either the bsmtp-send or note-send program to start the message transport.

Those programs are provided in this directory.
