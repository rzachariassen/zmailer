All versions of UCB Mail, and derivatives (mailx), have a nasty habit
of not depositing proper RFC822 mail when they should be.  This is most
apparent in the frequent lack of comma-separated addresses.  Sendmail
compensates for this, but that is not a good approach.  The code
already exists in UCB Mail to insert commas, except someone decided
this only needed to be done if there is an '@' sign anywhere on the
header line.  The included patch to the names.c file will hotwire the
insert-commas flag to always be set.  The patch shows the first few
lines of the detract() routine.  Binary sites with unstripped binaries
might be able to patch the object code correspondingly.

ZMailer doesn't do the necessary compensation, because it is extremely
ambiguous to parse such header values.
