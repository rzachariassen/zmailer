#
# Scheduler configuration file
#
# The scheduler reads this file on startup or when it receives a SIGUSR1 signal
#
# Every channel/host combination in recipient addresses will be sifted through
# the clauses matched in this file, picking up parameters until a clause that
# specifies a command.  Everything is free-form with three requirements:
# - Clauses (i.e. the channel/host pattern) start at the beginning of a line.
# - Clause contents (i.e. the parameters) start after some whitespace
# - Clause content keywords are matched case INSENSITIVE
# - Components are separated by whitespace.
# 
# Within command=" ... " strings, following "variables" are known:
#  $host	message's host
#  $channel	message's channel
#  ${LOGDIR}	ZENV variable LOGDIR (all ZENV variables supported)
#
# NB! For command paths, the $PATH is:  $MAILBIN/ta
# (Unless an absolute path is given for a command)
# for *running* things, the CWD is: $POSTOFFICE/transport/
#

#
# Note, there are three kinds of resource-pool limitation parameters
# which control when a given channel+host pair (thread) is NOT taken
# into processing:
#
#  MaxTA:  (Set in "*/*" clause)
#       GLOBAL parameter limiting the number of transport-agent processes
#       that the scheduler can have running at the same time.
#
#	With this you can limit the number of TA processes running at the
#	same time lower than maximum allowed by your OS setup.
#
#	The scheduler detects the max number of FDs allowed for a process,
#	and analyzing how many FDs each TA interface will need -- plus
#	reserving 10 FDs for the itself, result is ``probed maxkids''.
#
#  MaxChannel: (default: ``probed maxkids'')
#       Selector clause specific value limiting how many transport-agent
#       processes can be running on which the ``channel'' part is the same.
#       You may specify dis-similar values for these as well.  For example
#       you may use value '50' for all your 'smtp' channel entries, except
#       that you want always to guarantee at least five more for your own
#       domain deliveries, and thus have:
#               smtp/*your.domain
#                       maxchannel=55
#       If the sum of all ``maxchannel'' values in different channels exceeds
#       that of ``maxta'', then ``maxta'' value will limit the amount of work
#       done in extreme load situations.
#
#  MaxRing:  ( default: ``probed maxkids'' )
#       This limits the number of parallel transport agents within each
#       selector definition.    This defined the size of the POOL of
#       transport agent processes available for processing the threads
#       matching the selector clause.
#
#  MaxTHR:   ( max processes per thread; default: 1 )
#       This limits the number of parallel transport agents within each
#       thread; that is, using higher value than default ``1'' will allow
#       running more than one TA for the jobs at the thread.
#
#	Do note that running more than one TA in parallel may also require
#	lowering OVERFEED value.  (E.g. having a queue of 30 messages will
#	not benefit from more TAs, unless they all get something to process.
#	Having OVERFEED per default at 150 will essentially feed whole queue
#	to one TA, others are not getting any.)
#
#  OverFeed:
#	This tells how many job specifiers to feed to the TA when
#	the TA process state is ``STUFFING''  Because the scheduler
#	is a bit sluggish to spin around to spot active TAs, it does
#	make sense to feed more than one task to a TA, and then wait
#	for the results.
#

#
# There are also a few flags directing various things
#
#  QueueOnly:
#	Existence directs threads created under this clause *NEVER* to
#	auto-start with any timeout mechanism.  Usage of ETRN methods
#	is required for the thread to start!
#
#  WakeupRestartOnly:
#	Existence directs threads created under this clause to start
#	at the arrival of the first message to the thread, but in case
#	the thread exists, and is in ``WAKEUP DELAY'' state, new arrival
#	does not start the thread.
#
#  AgeOrder:
#	This directs the queue *always* to run in strict arrival time
#	order.  It might not make sense in all situations, though..
#	Originally the system ran always by permuting the thread order
#	before running TAs so that if some message causes the thread to
#	hang, others will get processed past it.
#
#  ByHost:
#	The command-line of the clause has ``$host'' expansion in it, OR
#	the channel-part of the clause selector has wild-cards in it, (or
#	the user decided to have ``byhost'' directive just for the fun of it.)
#	Switching TAs in between threads might not be advised..
#	(well, use of  ``$host''  isn't advisable in general..)
#	(also, having wild-cards at the channel-part is not advised..)
#
#  ByChannel:
#	The command-line of the clause has  ``$channel'' expansion in it, (or
#	the user decided to have ``byhost'' directive just for the fun of it.)
#	This flag is not really used anywhere.
