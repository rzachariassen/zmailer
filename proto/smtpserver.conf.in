#  Note about the style-flags: 'ftve' set needs enable-router!
#    The system will not complain about lack of it (since 2.99.56),
#    but without that enable, those four flags have no effect.
#
#  List of supported style flags:
#    f     Process MAIL FROM thru the interactive router
#    t     Process RCPT TO thru the interactive router
#    v     Process VRFY thru the interactive router
#    e     Process EXPN thru the interactive router
#    R     Require always fully-qualified addresses for MAIL FROM,
#          and for RCPT TO; that is, have @ and domain.
#          ( <postmaster> is the only exception! )
#    S     Allow utter sloppyness in input syntax; mainly extra
#          white-spaces in places where they don't belong are
#          tolerated.  Also lack of HELO/EHLO greeting is allowed!
#    h     Process HELO parameter thru the interactive router
#          Use of this IS NOT RECOMMENED, but is here for the
#          completeness sake...
#    D     Don't Discard; protocol timeouts leave behind files in
#          the $POSTOFFICE/public/ directory with suffixes:
#               .SMTP-TIMEOUT   .DATA-EOF    .BDAT-EOF
#          depending on where the abort happened..
#
#localhost           * ftveR
#some.host.domain    * !NO EMAIL ACCEPTED FROM YOUR MACHINE
# If the host presents itself as:  HELO [1.2.3.4], be lenient to it..
# The syntax below is due to these patterns being SH-GLOB style patterns
# where the brackets are special characters.
\[*\]                * ve
# Per default demand strict syntactic adherence, including fully
# qualified addresses for  MAIL FROM, and RCPT TO.  To be lenient
# on that detail, remove the "R" from "veR" string below:
