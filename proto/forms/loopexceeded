SUB Subject: Too many "Received:" lines, looping message ?

The following message was decided to exceed the sensible limit
on the number of "Received:" headers, which number is usually
fairly small for any average email, but can become rather large,
if the message loops somewhere.

Our limit is 50 rounds, usually systems set it way lower, like
at 15-17...
