One or more of the addresses you specified in the following message
were not recognized as addresses that can be reached from this system.

The message refers to a host or domain name which is not known at this
gateway, yet which should be known here if it exists.  It is therefore
likely that said host or domain name does NOT exist.  Most times people
think they are part of our domain when they really are not, and some
times the mailer configuration really isn't consistent with reality.
If you care either way, a query to the Postmaster at this host should
give a definitive response.

Your message is being returned unprocessed.
