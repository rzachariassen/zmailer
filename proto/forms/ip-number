SUB Subject: Usage of IP-number as an address (error)

The following message arrived with illegal envelope data, typically a
mangled address that doesn't obey the RFC822/976 protocol specification.

Some  BSD sendmail  systems allow users to use IP-addresses as address

Again: THIS KLUDGE SHOULD NEVER BE USED!

Your message is being returned unprocessed.
