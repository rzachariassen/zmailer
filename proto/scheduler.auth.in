#
# APOP-like authentication control file for the ZMailer scheduler.
#
# Fields are double-colon (':') separated, and are:
#   - Username
#   - PLAINTEXT PASSWORD (which must not have double-colon in it!)
#   - Enabled attributes (tokens, space separated)
#   - Addresses in brackets plus netmask widths:  [1.2.3.4]/32
#
# Same userid CAN appear multiple times, parsing will pick the first
# instance of it which has matching IP address set
#
# The default-account for 'mailq' is 'nobody' with password 'nobody'.
# Third field is at the moment a WORK IN PROGRESS!
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
#   OWNER:      root
#   PROTECTION: 0600
#
# Attribute tokens:
#	ALL	well, a wild-card enabling everything
#	SNMP	"SHOW SNMP"
#	QQ	"SHOW QUEUE SHORT"
#	TT	"SHOW QUEUE THREADS", "SHOW THREAD channel/host"
#	ETRN	"START THREAD channel host"
#	KILL	"KILL THREAD channel host", "KILL MSG spoolid"
#
# Plus in case of the smtpserver sharing this same file:
#       SMTPIP  set of "Z-REPORT user pass IP ..." reports.
#
# - "nobody" via loopback gets different treatment from
#   "nobody" from anywhere else.
