# Routing Configuration File
#
# Entries in this file are checked first by router.cf. they have the form
#	name	channel!next_destination
# A leading . on the name indicates that all subdomains match as well
#
# We have TWO different fallback lookup tags:
#       .:ERROR  for cases where ERROR MESSAGES we generated are being routed
#       .        for general case
#
# This dictomy is due to need to route everything by explicite tables,
# EXCEPT in case of errors when '.' maps to 'error!something'
# ("We know to whom we route, others get error report back.")
#
# To generate runtime BINARY database of this source, issue command:
#   $MAILBIN/newdb $MAILSHARE/db/routes
# or in this directory with usual configuration:
#   ../bin/newdb routes
#

#
#  Sample route statements (and channels):
#
#	.foo  error!cannedmsgfilename
#	#	Canned error message from $MAILSHARE/forms/cannedmsgfilename
#
#	.bar  smtpx!
#	#	Send all traffic destined to any subdomain under this
#	#	suffix via "smtpx" channel to that domain
#
#	.bar  smtp-etrn!
#	.bar  smtp-tls!
#	.bar  smtp-log!
#	.bar  smtp77!
#	.bar  smtp77x!
#	.bar  smtp8!
#	.bar  smtp8x!
#	#	Ditto
#
#	.bar  smtpgw-xyz!
#	#	Drives genericish gateway function kit
#
#	junkdom      bitbucket!
#	myself       local!
#	news.domain  usenet!
#	uunode.dom   uucp!uunode
#
#	# Usual ISP smart-host setup
#	.	smtpx!ISP.smtp.gw
#
#	# Not so usual - fallback to error, except for error messages
#	.:ERROR	smtp!
#	.	error!notourcustomer
#
