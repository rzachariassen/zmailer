#
#  UserDB per sendmail's approach
#
#  This can be used to map local names into outgoing fqdn addresses.
#  There are white-space separated key and data fields.  Essentially
#  the result set is processed as an Alias set, e.g.:
#     root:maildrop    sysadmin@here.dom,bill@three.dom
#  The keys are unqualified userids which will be mapped thru either
#     user:mailname  ->  user.name@here.dom
#     user.name:maildrop -> user
#
#  Sendmail has also mapping key  :default:mailname  however ZMailer
#  doesn't support that one.
#
#  CURRENTLY ZMAILER SUPPORTS ONLY "user:mailname" MAPPINGS
#  (2000-March-28)  Use standard aliases for maildrop mapping.
#

#user:mailname		user.name@here.dom
