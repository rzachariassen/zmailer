# FQDN-ROUTES
#
# Entries in this file are checked first by router.cf. they have the forms:
#	user@domain	channel!additional-data
#	@domain		channel!additional-data
#
# The percent-substitutions are supported at these datatabases.
#   %0   =  used lookup key
#   %1   =  user (sans possible "+tail")
#   %2   =  possible "+tail"
#   %3   =  athost ("@domain")
#   %4   =  domain ("domain")  (possible dummy..)
#   %5   =  address  -  the full original address
#
#
# We have FOUR different fallback lookup tags:
#       .:ERROR	   For cases where error messages WE generated are being routed
#	.:sender   For routing sender addresses - never in practise
#	.:recipient For routing recipient addresses
#       .          For general case
#
# This dictomy is due to need to route everything by explicite tables,
# EXCEPT in case of errors when '.' maps to 'error!something'
# ("We know to whom we route, others get error report back.")
#
# To generate runtime BINARY database of this source, issue command:
#   $MAILBIN/newdb $MAILSHARE/db/fqdnroutes
# or in this directory with usual configuration:
#   ../bin/newdb fqdnroutes
# Or:
#   ../bin/zmailer newdb
#

#
#  Sample route statements (and channels):
#
#	.:ERROR	ignore!
#	# Orders to ignore the fqdnroute database for error cases.
#	# Use of other methods for routing locally generated error messages
#	# is suggested
#
#	.:recipient  error!cannedmsgfilename
#	.            error!cannedmsgfilename
#	.	     error!notourcustomer
#	#	Canned error message from $MAILSHARE/forms/cannedmsgfilename
#
#	user@domain   smtp!%3!%5
#	@domain	      smtp!%3!%5
#
#	@domain	      error!nosuchuser
#
#       user@domain  local!%1%2
#	user@domain  lmtp!lmtphost!%5
#

.:ERROR		ignore!
