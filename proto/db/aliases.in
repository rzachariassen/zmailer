##  Doing expansion lists in sendmail -style is NOT suggested, although
##  we certainly can do it!  There is a better mechanism in the ZMailer
##  to handle simple feats like these that sendmail -systems do by placeing
##  the file containing recipient addresses into directory  $MAILVAR/lists/
##  (directory must have protection of 2775 or stricter, and the listfile
##   must have protection of 664 or stricter for *-request/owner-*/*-owner
##   auto-aliases to work!) -- but to sendmail style lists:
##

listname: "/usr/lib/sendmail -fowner-listname listname-dist"
owner-listname: root # Well, what would you suggest for a sample ?
listname-owner: owner-listname
listname-request: root
listname-dist: ":include:/dev/null"
