# Left side: FQDN-form of some address, Right side: rewritten form
#
# This map tried BEFORE the address is fed even to tests wether or not
# the address is local or not!
#
# Refreshing this mapping is done with program  MAILBIN/newfqdnaliases
# (no way to call it via some non-MAILBIN program..)
#
# We support here entries like:
#  local.part@domain.name: new@address
#  @domain.name:	new2@address2
