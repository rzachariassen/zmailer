#| The "iproutes" database is the file $MAILVAR/db/iproutes.
#| It contains routing exceptions for hosts or domains that would
#| otherwise be routed by the normal database lookups for a particular
#| network or protocol.  The value is expected to be in the following
#| form:

#|      channel "!" host [ { "!" host } ]

#| The channel is a well-known channel from the set: local, error, ignore,
#| smtp, uucp, ean, usenet, bsmtp3, bitnet2, bitnet2truncate, defrt1, and
#| defrt1truncate.  The exact set depends on which protocols are
#| supported by the loaded configuration.

#| For example, the line:

#|      .domain         uucp!host1!host2

#| would send all mail for domain or its subdomains to host1 via UUCP,
#| with a request to remail to host2!address.  This is pathalias output
#| semantics.

#| The line

#|      host            smtp![192.12.180.4]

#| would send all mail for host to the SMTP server on the host at IP
#| address 192.12.180.4.
