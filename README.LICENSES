	Licenses for ZMailer, and bundled components

		ARTISTIC   BSD	GPL-2	LGPL-2

Also other licenses may apply, see files/symlinks in  LICENSES/  subdirectory.


Below "you" is defined as packager, not as recipient of that package.
The packager must indicate which license(s) have been chosen to apply.

The license for ZMailer is herewith set as: "pick any you like":

    - ARTISTIC:
		The PERL way; respect copyrights, otherwise do whatever
		you like, preferrably also contribute changes to the
		baseline.  Details are in the file.

    - BSD:
		Demands only, that you don't remove copyright
		notices. Otherwise you are free to e.g. hoard your
		changes / new features.  Details are in the file.

    - GPL-2 / LGPL-2:
		Of these the LGPL is applicable to all parts of ZMailer
		that are libraries, or you were able to otherwise embedd
		in librarized form.  Otherwise use GPL.

		Demands contributing changes back to the baseline or
		very least redistributing (or offering to..) sources
		along with binaries, etc.  Details are in the file.


I (Matti Aarnio) have also contemplated adapting Mozilla/Netscape community
license, or Qt's QPL, but those go a tad far in demands of wanting the
modifications to be fed to the original author.
